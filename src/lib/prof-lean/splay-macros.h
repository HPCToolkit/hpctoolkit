/*
 *  The Sleator-Tarjan top-down splay algorithm for regular,
 *  single-key trees.
 *
 *  This macro is the body of the splay function.  It rotates the node
 *  containing "key" to the root, if there is one, else the new root
 *  will be an adjacent node (left or right).
 *
 *  The general macro takes 2 comparisons as arguments
 *   [ Frequently, only 1 is necessary, but occasionally, when the keys are
 *   not a primitive data type, the lt and gt operations may not show the
 *   same symmetry as the purely mathematical operations.
 *
 *     lt(a, b)  // defines the "less than" comparison
 *     gt(a, b)  // defines the "greater than" comparison
 *
 *  Nodes in the tree should be a struct with name "type" containing
 *  at least these field names with these types:
 *
 *    lt_field: the field of the key used with "less than" comparisons
 *    gt_field: the field of the key used with "greater than" comparisons
 *
 *    left    : struct type *,
 *    right   : struct type *.
 *
 *   NB: lt_field and gt_field are frequently the same field, but, in general,
 *       they can be different
 *
 *  "root" is a struct type * and is reset to the new root.
