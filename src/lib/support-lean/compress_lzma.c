	// to compress a .xz file. It can vary from less than a megabyte to
	// a few gigabytes, but in practice (at least for now) it rarely
	// exceeds 65 MiB because that's how much memory is required to
	// decompress files created with "xz -9". Settings requiring more
	// memory take extra effort to use and don't (at least for now)
	// provide significantly better compression in most cases.
	//
	// Memory usage limit is useful if it is important that the
	// decompressor won't consume gigabytes of memory. The need
	// for limiting depends on the application. In this example,
	// no memory usage limiting is used. This is done by setting
	// the limit to UINT64_MAX.
	//
	// The .xz format allows concatenating compressed files as is:
	//
	//     echo foo | xz > foobar.xz
	//     echo bar | xz >> foobar.xz
	//
	// When decompressing normal standalone .xz files, LZMA_CONCATENATED

	// .xz files. If LZMA_CONCATENATED isn't used, the decoder will stop
	// after the first .xz stream. This can be useful when .xz data has
	// been embedded inside another file format.
	//
	// Flags other than LZMA_CONCATENATED are supported too, and can
	// be combined with bitwise-or. See lzma/container.h
