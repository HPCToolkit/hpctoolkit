// File:
//   Structure-Cache.hpp
//
// Purpose:
//   functions that support management of a cache for hpcstruct files
//
//***************************************************************************

// Cache structure:
//    The top-level directory of the cache is specified by the user.  We refer
//    to it as "CACHE" below, although the user can pick an arbitrary name.
//
//  All binaries in the cache are named by their elf-hash, a cryptographic hash
//    of the file's contents, expressed as a 32-character string.
//      (See .../src/lib/prof-lean for the implementation).
//
//  There are two subdirectories in the CACHE:  CACHE/FLAT and CACHE/PATH
//    CACHE/FLAT is a directory with one entry for every binary stored in the cache
//      Each of those entries is a symlink to a corresponding directory in CACHE/PATH.
//      Each is named by the hash of the binary.
//
//    Entries in CACHE/PATH are stored in subdirectories named with the full path
//      to the binary to which is appended a subdirectory named by the hash.
//      That subdirectory contains a file named "hpcstruct" which is the fully
//      processed structure file for the binary.
//      The gaps file, when generated with "--show-gaps", will be named gaps, in
//	the same subdirectory
//
//    GPU binaries are handled slightly differently.  The name of the GPU binary
//      The structure file when generated with "--gpucfg no", the default, will be named hpcstruct
//      The structure file when generated with "--gpucfg yes" will be named hpcstruct+gpucfg
//
//    If a GPU binary is reprocessed with a different --gpucfg value, there may be
//	three different files in that subdirectory: hpcstruct, hpcstruct+gpucfg, and gaps
//
