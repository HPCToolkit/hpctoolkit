This directory contains the implementation of perf-events for HPCToolkit (hpcrun).
The files in this directory (ordered based on its importance):

linux_perf.c: the main code, contains interface with sample-sourcesa and 
 			  the driver of all linux' perf event functionality
 			  
perfmon-util.*: interface for libpfm4 library to gather information on native
				hardware (and software) counters.			  

perf-util.*: swiss army utility (bad name, needs to be renamed).
 
kernel_blocking.*: specialized event to compute the blocking time spent in
 					the kernel. Currently only available if the kernel is a
 					Linux 4.3 version or later.
 					
perf_mmap.*: utility to parse mmap buffer and copy it in a data structure.

perf_skid.*: special module to parse precise_ip modifier in an event.

perf_barrier.*: library containing the definition and implementation of all
				barrier for most of the platforms.
				
event_custom.*: our predefined events. Useful for top-down predefined summary
				events, or when perfmon is not available.
