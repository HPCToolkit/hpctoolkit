/*
 * function: executable_path
 *
 * purpose: 
 *    search for an executable file that matches 'filename'  
 *    relative to the current directory or a colon separated
 *    list of  paths
 *
 * return value: 
 *   upon success, it will return the value supplied as path_name
 *            
 *
 * NOTES:
 * 1. path_list is a colon separated list of paths to search
 *    for filename.
 * 2. path_name must point to a buffer of length PATH_MAX
 * 2. this routine can't allocate any memory, which
 *    makes the implementation a bit more complicated.
