Latex2man
is a tool to translate UNIX manual pages written with 
LaTeXinto a format understood by the UNIX man(1)-command.
Alternatively HTML, TexInfo, or LaTeX code can be produced too. 
Output of parts of the text may be suppressed using the conditional text 
feature (for this, LaTeX generation may be used).

@section Description

Latex2man
reads the file @var{infile}
and writes @var{outfile}.
The 
input must be a LaTeX document using the latex2man
LaTeXpackage. 
Latex2man
translates that document into the troff(1)
format using 
the -man
macro package. 

Using the -H
option, HTML code can be produced, instead of 
troff(1).

Using the -T
option, TexInfo code can be produced, instead of 
troff(1).

Using the -M
option, troff(1)
input is produced. 

Using the -L
option, LaTeX ouput can be produced, instead of 
troff(1).

@node Options,  Files,  Description, Top  
@section Options

@table @samp
@item -t@var{transfile}
Translation for user defined LaTeX macros. 
@item -M
Produce output suitable for the man(1)
command (default). 
@item -H
Instead of producing output suitable for the man(1)
command, HTML code is produced (despite the name of the command). 
@item -T
Instead of producing output suitable for the man(1)
command, TexInfo code is produced (despite the name of the command). The 
generated @file{.texi}-file
may be processed with makeinfo(1)
(to produce an @file{.info}-file)
which in turn may be installed using 
install-info(1).
The Info tags @t{@@dircategory} and 
@t{@@direntry} are provided. 
@item -L
The LaTeX source is written to the @var{outfile}.
This is 
useful in conjunction with the -C@var{name}
option. 
@item -C@var{name}
Output the conditional text for @var{name}.
If more 
than one name should be given use quotes: -C@var{'name1 name2 ...'}@*

The following names are defined automatically: 
@itemize @bullet
@item
-H defines @t{HTML}
@item
-T defines @t{TEXI}
@item
-M defines @t{MAN}
@item
-L defines @t{LATEX}
@end itemize
@item -a@var{char}
Is used only in conjunction with -T.@*

Background:@*

TexInfo ignores all blanks before the first word on a new line. In order 
to produce some additional space before that word (using \SP) some 
character has to be printed before the additional space. By default this 
is a . (dot). The @var{char}
specifies an alternative for that first 
character. Giving a blank to 
-a
supresses the indentation of a line.@*

Note: only for the first \SP of a series that @var{char}
is printed. 
@item -h
Show a help text. 
@item -V

The LaTeX package @t{latex2man}
is used to write the Man-pages with 
LaTeX.Since we translate into other text formats, not all LaTeX stuff can 
be translated. 

@node Package Options,  Package Specific Environments,  LaTeX commands, Top 
@subsection Package Options

The @t{latex2man}
package accepts the following options: 

@table @samp
@item fancy
use the LaTeX package @t{fancyheadings}.
@item fancyhdr
use the LaTeX package @t{fancyhdr}.
@item nofancy
neither the LaTeX package @t{fancyheadings}
nor 
@t{fancyhdr}
are used. 
@end table

The default option may be specified in the file @t{latex2man.cfg}.

@node Package Specific Environments,  Accepted LaTeX Environments, Package Options, Top  
@subsection Package Specific Environments


The following environments are provided by the package: 
@table @samp
@item \begin@{Name@}@{chapter@}@{name@}@{author@}@{info@}@{title@} 
The 
@t{Name}
environment takes five arguments: 1.  the Man-page chapter, 
2.  the name of the Man-page, 3.  the author, 4.  some short information 
about the tool printed in the footline of the Man-page, and 5.  a text 
which is used as title, for HTML and LaTeX (it's ignored for output of 
the Man-page or TeXinfo. The @t{Name}
environment must be the first 
environment in the document. Processing starts with this environment. Any 
text before this is ignored (exception: the @t{setVersion} and 
@t{setDate} commands). (Note: all arguments of \begin@{Name@} must 
be written on one line). 
@item \begin@{Table@}[width]@{columns@}
The @t{Table}
environment takes two arguments: the first optional one specifies 
a width of the last column, the second one gives the number of columns. 
For example: 

@t{\begin@{Table@}[2cm]@{3@}} @*

@t{Here & am & I \\\hline} @*

@t{A 1 & A 2 & A 3 1 2 3 4 5 A 3 1 2 3 4 5 \\} @*

@t{B 1 & B 2 & B 3 \\} @*

@t{\end@{Table@}} 

will be typeset as: 

@multitable @columnfractions  0.3 0.3 0.3
@item Here @tab  am @tab  I 

@item 
A 1 @tab  A 2 @tab  A 3 1 2 3 4 5 A 3 1 2 3 4 5

@item B 1 @tab  B 2 @tab  B 3 

@end multitable

If no optional @emph{width}
argument is given, all entries are 
typeset left justified. 
The @emph{width}
is a length measured absolutly in @emph{cm}.
Processing with LaTeX a @t{p@{width@}} column is typeset 
as last column. The translation to troff(1)
commands 
results in a @t{lw(width)}
column specification. Translating 
to HTML and TexInfo ignores the @emph{width}
parameter. 

@t{\hline} may be used. 

If the Man-page is formatted with troff(1)
and tables are used, the 
tbl(1)
preprocessor should be called, usually by giving 
a -t
to the call of troff(1).
When viewing the generated 
manula page using man(1),
tbl(1)
is called automatically. 
@item \begin@{Description@}
is the same as \begin@{description@} 
@item \begin@{Description@}[label]
is similar to 
\begin@{description@}, but the item labels have at minimum the size 
of the (optional) word @emph{label}.
The difference is visible only 
in the DVI and PDF-output, not in the troff, TexInfo or HTML output. 
@table @samp

@node Conditional Text,  Translation of User Defined Macros,  Accepted LaTeX Macros, Top 
@subsection Conditional Text


latex2man
preprocesses the LaTeX input to allow text to be used 
conditionally. A special sort of LaTeX comment is used for that purpose. 
@itemize @bullet
@item
%@@% IF @emph{condition} %@@%
@item
%@@% ELSE %@@% 
@item
%@@% END-IF %@@% 
@end itemize

A line must contain only such a comment and nothing else. @emph{condition}
is 
a boolean expression containing ``names'' and operators. The names given with 
the -C@var{name}
option have the value ``true'', while all other names 
occuring in the expression are assumed to be ``false''. If the evaluation of 
the boolean expression results in the value ``true'', the text in the 
``then''-part is used and the text in the optional ``else''-part is skipped 
(and vice versa). The @t{IF/ELSE/END-IF}
may be nested. As boolean 
operators the following are allowed: 

@multitable @columnfractions  0.45 0.45
@item ||@tab  boolean or 

@item && @tab  boolean and 

@item ! @tab  negation 
@end multitable

( and ) for grouping are allowed. 

@noindent

For example:@*

%@@% IF abc %@@%@*

@t{}abc set@*

@t{}%@@%  IF xyz %@@%@*

@t{}xyz set@*

@t{}%@@%  ELSE %@@%@*

@t{}xyz NOT set@*

@t{}xyz OR !XYZ NOT set@*

@t{}%@@%  END-IF %@@%@*

%@@% END-IF %@@%

@noindent

Run this manual page through latex2man
with e.g.  
-C@var{'abc XYZ'}
and have a look to the generated output. 
(If simply running the LaTeX-document through LaTeX,all lines are shown in the

The user macro translation file (given by the [ -t@var{transfile} ])
