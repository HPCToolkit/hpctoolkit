Uses Autoconf, but not Automake.
Supports vpath build directory.

CC=gcc CFLAGS='...' ./configure --prefix=PATH
make
make install

Note: configure does not accept CC and CFLAGS on the command line
after the ./configure command.  It misinterprets those as trying to
set the host type.  CC and CFLAGS, if used, must be given as
environment variables before the ./configure command.
