Prereqs: binutils (libbfd and libiberty)

Uses Autoconf and Automake, supports vpath and parallel builds.

../configure \
    CC=  CFLAGS=  CXX=  CXXFLAGS=  \
    CPPFLAGS="-I /path/to/binutils/include" \
    --prefix=/path/to/prefix \
    --with-binutils=/path/to/binutils \
    --disable-gui \
    --without-java
make
make install

Our Java support only needs libopagent and opjitconv (and libutil as
prereq).  Other parts of oprofile need kernel access which would be
awkward for us.

Libopagent and opjitconv are all C, not C++.  But we configure with
both CC and CXX so that configure doesn't pick a default CXX that is
inconsistent with our CC.

Oprofile uses libiberty but doesn't have an option for an alternate
install path (only looks in /usr).  But setting CPPFLAGS works.

Libopagent uses libiberty for a shared library.  So we now build
binutils with -fPIC for oprofile.  Libiberty is a common library, but
it's not always built with -fPIC, so we use our binutils.
