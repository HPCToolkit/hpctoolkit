For now, we only install the boost header files, not build any
libraries.

The full boost package is quite large (50 Meg tar file, 450 Meg
unpacked).  This boost-headers tar file is the original tar file minus
the doc, libs, status and tools subdirectories.  SymtabAPI only uses
boost header files, not any libraries.  So, this saves considerable
time and space.

This is version 1.51.0.  Beginning with version 1.52.0, boost changed
the boost::result_of component to use the new C++11 decltype keyword.
According to Boost, this is "a key piece of library infrastructure"
and they "have found this change to be moderately disruptive."
SymtabAPI is conservative in their use of boost (they use 1.42.0).
So, we'll stay pre-1.52.0 until they advance.
