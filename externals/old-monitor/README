No configure script, uses custom Makefile.

make PREFIX=/path
make PREFIX=/path install

Has build problems with some non-gcc compilers.

Setting CFLAGS on the make line conflicts with its setting in
tests/src/Makefile.

This is Phil Mucci's monitor from Univ of Tennessee.
Hpcrun with flat profiling still uses this version
and has not yet switched to new SciDAC libmonitor.
