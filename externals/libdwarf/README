Libdwarf Build Notes
=====================

Home: http://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html

Download: http://www.prevanders.net/libdwarf-20130126.tar.gz

License: LGPL (libdwarf), GPL (dwarfdump)

Uses Autoconf, but not Automake, does support VPATH.

../configure CC=gcc CFLAGS='-g -O2 -fPIC'  \
    --enable-shared --disable-nonshared
make
manually copy files

Note: The dwarf tarball includes both dwarfdump and libdwarf, but we
only use libdwarf.

Note: Doesn't build both static and shared libraries in the same
build.  They require different CFLAGS (-fPIC), so it takes two builds
to make both static and shared.

Note: Makefile has no install target.
