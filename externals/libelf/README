Uses Autoconf, but not Automake.
Supports vpath build directory.

export CC=gcc CFLAGS='...'
./configure --prefix=PATH --enable-compat
make
make install

Note: configure does not accept CC and CFLAGS on the command line
after the ./configure command.  It misinterprets those as trying to
set the host type.  CC and CFLAGS, if used, must be given as
environment variables before the ./configure command.

Note: --enable-compat forces libelf to install libelf.h, gelf.h and
nlist.h in <prefix>/include, rather than include/libelf.  The default
is to check /usr/include and not install them if they exist in /usr.
Symtab can't handle the libelf subdir and this option is a cleaner way
of solving the problem than patching symtab.
