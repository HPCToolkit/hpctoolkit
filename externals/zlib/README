Zlib Build Notes
=================

Home: http://www.zlib.net/

Download: http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.8.tar.gz

License: Custom, but similar to BSD.

Uses own configure and Makefile, no autotools.

export CC=gcc CFLAGS='...'
./configure --prefix=PATH --static
make
make install

1. Configure does not accept CC and CFLAGS on the command line.  These
must be set in the environment.

2. Does not support vpath builds.

3. Builds static and shared libraries, but we only use static.
