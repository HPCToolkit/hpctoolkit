1 Introduction
==============

Spack is a moving target and receives multiple commits per day.
Normally, HPCToolkit will build and run successfully with the latest
version of all of its prerequisite packages, but sometimes not.  This
page covers the current known issues where HPCToolkit fails to build
with the latest version of spack.  The main build directions are at:

   README.Install

Report problems to 'hpctoolkit-forum at rice dot edu'.  But before
reporting a problem, first try the versions recommended in the
'packages.yaml' file in the 'spack' subdirectory of the hpctoolkit
repository.  And always check the latest version of this file on the
hpctoolkit web site.

2 Current Issues
================

2.1 (2020-09-05) Configure warns about -fPIC.
---------------------------------------------

As of commit b2d3d067ecad
(https://github.com/HPCToolkit/hpctoolkit/pull/317) on 2020-09-05, the
master branch now wants libunwind and xz (lzma) to be built with variant
'+pic'.  This is used to workaround a deadlock with hpcrun, openmpi 4.x
and UCX. If not, then you'll see this warning at the bottom of
configure.

     WARNING: The following prereqs are missing an archive (.a) compiled with -fPIC.
     WARNING:    libunwind lzma
     WARNING:
     WARNING: hpcrun is unable to properly hide these libraries from the
     WARNING: application and this may cause deadlock or segfault.
     WARNING: Recompile the above libraries with -fPIC (+pic in spack).

For now, this is only a warning.  Everything will work as before, you
just won't get the benefit of the work around.  But going forward, you
should build libunwind and xz with variant '+pic'.  For example, in
'packages.yaml'.

     libunwind:
       version:  [1.4.0]
       variants: +xz +pic
     xz:
       version:  [5.2.5]
       variants: +pic

3 Recently Resolved Issues
==========================

3.1 (2020-06-29) Cray front-end compilers
-----------------------------------------

'Spack compiler find' was previously broken for detecting the front-end
compilers on Cray that HPCToolkit uses.

Fixed: This is now fixed in commit 789d060ff61b
(https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/17267) on 2020-06-29.

Note: Remember, you still need to fill in the 'modules:' field with the
following four modules.  For example, this is an entry for the
'gcc/8.3.0' module on theta at ANL. Note that the front-end
operating_system is something like 'sles15' (not 'cnl6'), and the
front-end target is 'x86_64' (not 'mic_knl').  Your versions may differ.

     - compiler:
         environment: {}
         flags: {}
         modules:
         - PrgEnv-gnu/6.0.7
         - gcc/8.3.0
         - craype/2.6.5
         - cray-mpich/7.7.14
         operating_system: sles15
         paths:
           cc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gcc
           cxx: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/g++
           f77: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
           fc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
         spec: gcc@8.3.0
         target: x86_64

4 General Problems
==================

These are general problems that arise from time to time.

4.1 Unable to fetch
-------------------

Sometimes spack fails to download the source file(s) for some package
and dies with a message similar to this.

     ==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz failed.
     ==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for m4-1.4.18-vorbvkcjfac43b7vuswsvnm6xe7w7or5

This problem is usually temporary and the solution is to either wait a
few minutes or an hour and try again, or else download the file manually
and put it into a spack mirror.

4.2 Connection timeout
----------------------

Another way fetch can fail is with a connection timeout.  Some sites,
especially sourceforge are often slow to connect.  If this happens, then
increase the connection timeout in 'config.yaml' to 30 or 60 seconds
(default is 10 seconds).

4.3 New version breaks the build
--------------------------------

Sometimes the latest version of some package breaks the build.  This has
happened a couple of times where a new version of Boost has broken the
build for Dyninst.  The solution is to revert the package to an earlier
version until the rest of the code catches up.

4.4 Spack core breaks the build
-------------------------------

Sometimes but rarely, something in the spack core will change or break
the code in some 'package.py' file.  The solution is to look through the
spack git log and revert the repository to a recent commit before the
breakage.

5 Long Term Issues
==================

5.1 Boost 1.68.0
----------------

Avoid boost version 1.68.0, it breaks the build for hpctoolkit.  Version
1.70.0 works with the latest version of dyninst (10.1.0), or else 1.66.0
is good and works with all versions of dyninst.

5.2 Elfutils 0.176
------------------

Elfutils 0.176 requires glibc 2.16 or later (for 'aligned_alloc') and
won't work with an older glibc, including RedHat or CentOS 6.x and Blue
Gene.  On systems with an old glibc, use version 0.175.

5.3 IBM-Java fails to fetch (powerpc)
-------------------------------------

IBM is fairly aggressive about taking down old versions, so you may find
that fetching ibm-java fails while trying to install hpcviewer (powerpc
only).

     ==> Installing ibm-java
     ==> No binary for ibm-java found: installing from source
     ==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed

If this happens, first compare 'spack info ibm-java' with what versions
are available at IBM's download site.  If there is another 8.0.x.y
version that spack understands that is still available for download,
then use that.

     <http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/systems/cloud/runtimes/java>

If not, then manually download the latest 8.0.x.y version, compute a
'sha256sum' checksum for the file and then edit the
'ibm-java/package.py' file to add this version.  And then report the
problem to the spack maintainer.
