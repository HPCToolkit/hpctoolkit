1 Introduction
==============

Spack is a moving target and receives multiple commits per day.
Normally, HPCToolkit will build and run successfully with the latest
version of all of its prerequisite packages, but sometimes not.  This
page covers the current known issues where HPCToolkit fails to build
with the latest version of spack.  The main build directions are at:

   README.Install

Report problems to 'hpctoolkit-forum at rice dot edu'.  But before
reporting a problem, first try the versions recommended in the
'packages.yaml' file in the 'spack' subdirectory of the hpctoolkit
repository.  And always check the latest version of this file on the
hpctoolkit web site.

2 Current Issues
================

2.1 (2020-03-27) Intel-TBB checksums don't match
------------------------------------------------

Intel recently moved the TBB project on GitHub to a new repository,
'oneAPI-SRC/oneTBB'.  When downloading the intel-tbb tar file, github
makes the tar file on the fly, and this includes the new top-level
directory name (oneTBB). The contents of the tar file are the same, but
the new directory name is enough to invalidate the spack checksum.

Fixed: The new checksums were added to spack in commit 16f104aafe2b
(https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/15675) on 2020-03-27.  So, if you
update your spack repository after this commit, then the checksums will
match.

Workaround: If you have an older spack repository, then you will need to
disable verifying checksums.

     spack install --no-checksum intel-tbb

2.2 (2019-09-25) New micro-architecture targets
-----------------------------------------------

Spack recently changed how it treats a system's architecture and target
to allow a hierarchy of fine-grained micro-architectures.  The 'target'
is now a specific micro-architecture (eg, haswell, ivybridge) instead of
a generic family (x86_64).  You will see this change in two main places:
in 'spack spec' and the path for the install directory.  For example,
'linux-rhel7-x86_64' might become 'linux-rhel7-broadwell'.  You can use
'spack arch' to see the list of generic families and micro-architecture
targets.

     spack arch --known-targets

Workaround: Instead of building for the micro-arch target, you can use
the 'target' option to build for a generic architecture family (x86_64,
ppc64, ppc64le, aarch64).  This is also useful for creating a shared
install that needs to work across multiple machines with different
micro-arch types.  For example:

     spack install hpctoolkit ... target=x86_64

If you want to use this target for all spack builds, then you can
specify this in 'packages.yaml'.  For example:

     packages:
       all:
         target: ['x86_64']

2.3 (2019-08-28) Cray front-end compilers
-----------------------------------------

'Spack compiler find' is currently broken for detecting the front-end
compilers on Cray that HPCToolkit uses.  Normally, you would load a
module for gcc and run 'spack compiler find' and spack would add that
compiler to 'compilers.yaml', but this currently does not work.

   Workaround: If you have a working 'compiler:' entry for a front-end
GNU compiler on Cray, then that will continue to work.  If not, then you
will have to add one manually.  For example, this is an entry for the
'gcc/7.3.0' module on theta at ANL. Note that the front-end
operating_system is something like 'sles12' (not 'cnl6'), and the
front-end target is 'x86_64' (not 'mic_knl').

     - compiler:
         environment: {}
         extra_rpaths: []
         flags: {}
         modules:
         - PrgEnv-gnu/6.0.4
         - gcc/7.3.0
         - cray-mpich/7.7.3
         operating_system: sles12
         paths:
           cc:  /opt/gcc/7.3.0/bin/gcc
           cxx: /opt/gcc/7.3.0/bin/g++
           f77: /opt/gcc/7.3.0/bin/gfortran
           fc:  /opt/gcc/7.3.0/bin/gfortran
         spec: gcc@7.3.0
         target: x86_64

Workaround: Alternatively, the last working commit was '9c1c50fb7632' on
2019-06-07.  You could revert to this commit, run 'spack compiler find'
and then return to the current spack head (develop).  Be sure to fill in
the 'modules:' field.

3 Recently Resolved Issues
==========================

3.1 (2019-11-19) External perl breaks libunwind
-----------------------------------------------

A recent commit ('99dfff447509' on 2019-11-04, but merged on 11-18)
modified the treatment of PATH for packages that depend on perl.  If you
use 'packages.yaml' to specify an external perl from a system directory
such as '/usr/bin', then this puts '/usr/bin' at the front of PATH
during the build.  Unfortunately, this covers up all of the other build
dependencies and can break the build.

   For example, on systems with an older libtool, this breaks libunwind
as follows.

     294   libtool: Version mismatch error.  This is libtool 2.4.2, but the
     295   libtool: definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.4.6.
     296   libtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.4.2
     297   libtool: and run autoconf again.

Fixed: This is now fixed in commit cacfc3a6e1c7
(https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13903) on 2019-11-29.  Or, you can
workaround the problem by not using an external perl and instead having
spack build perl itself.

3.2 (2019-10-08) Python 3.x breaks PAPI
---------------------------------------

Python 2.x is nearing end-of-life and Spack recently changed their
launch script to look for and use python 3.x if available.  There are
incompatibilities and some spack packages (including PAPI) currently
break with python 3.x.  (The papi recipe hangs while patching files with
'filter_file'.)  There are two workarounds, depending on whether python
2.x is available on your system.

Fixed: The filter file problem is now fixed in commit 5cd28847e81b
(https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12765) on 2019-10-15.

   Workaround: If python 2.x is available on your system, then one
solution is to remove the test for 'python3' in the 'bin/spack' launch
script.

     # This file is bilingual. The following shell code finds our preferred python.
     # Following line is a shell no-op, and starts a multi-line Python comment.
     # See https://stackoverflow.com/a/47886254
     """:"
     # prefer python3, then python, then python2
     for cmd in python3 python python2; do
        command -v > /dev/null $cmd && exec $cmd $0 "$@"
     done

3.3 (2019-08-28) External cuda modules
--------------------------------------

Sometimes spack misreads the 'module:' entry for an external package in
'packages.yaml' and selects the wrong install directory.  For example,
spack misreads the 'cuda/10.1.168' module on cori at NERSC (incorrectly
using /usr) and the build for hpctoolkit fails as follows.

     ==> cuda@10.1.168 : has external module in cuda/10.1.168
     ==> cuda@10.1.168 : is actually installed in /usr

     .../configure --prefix='...' ... '--with-cuda=/usr'
     >> 208    configure: error: '/usr/include/cuda.h' not found

Fixed: This is now fixed in commit b1868f35ec91
(https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12693) on 2019-09-11.  Or, you can
workaround the problem by replacing 'modules:' with a 'paths:' entry.

     cuda:
       paths:
         cuda@10.1.168:  /usr/common/software/cuda/10.1.168

3.4 (2019-08-19) Build stage not writable
-----------------------------------------

Spack has reorganized the build directories and the value for
'build_stage' in 'config.yaml' may not work.

     build_stage:
       - $tempdir/spack-stage

The problem with this value is that the first user to run spack on this
machine will create the directory, owned by that user and thus not
writable by any other user.  For every other user, 'spack install' will
fail with:

     ==> Error: No accessible stage paths in:

Fixed: This is now fixed in commit c141e99e062b
(https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12516) on 2019-09-03.  Check your
'build_stage' directory and make sure that you have write access.  One
solution is to add '$user' to the path.

     build_stage:
       - $tempdir/$user/spack-stage

4 General Problems
==================

These are general problems that arise from time to time.

4.1 Unable to fetch
-------------------

Sometimes spack fails to download the source file(s) for some package
and dies with a message similar to this.

     ==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz failed.
     ==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for m4-1.4.18-vorbvkcjfac43b7vuswsvnm6xe7w7or5

This problem is usually temporary and the solution is to either wait a
few minutes or an hour and try again, or else download the file manually
and put it into a spack mirror.

4.2 New version breaks the build
--------------------------------

Sometimes the latest version of some package breaks the build.  This has
happened a couple of times where a new version of Boost has broken the
build for Dyninst.  The solution is to revert the package to an earlier
version until the rest of the code catches up.

4.3 Spack core breaks the build
-------------------------------

Sometimes but rarely, something in the spack core will change or break
the code in some 'package.py' file.  The solution is to look through the
spack git log and revert the repository to a recent commit before the
breakage.

5 Long Term Issues
==================

5.1 Boost 1.68.0
----------------

Avoid boost version 1.68.0, it breaks the build for hpctoolkit.  Version
1.70.0 works with the latest version of dyninst (10.1.0), or else 1.66.0
is good and works with all versions of dyninst.

5.2 Elfutils 0.176
------------------

Elfutils 0.176 requires glibc 2.16 or later (for 'aligned_alloc') and
won't work with an older glibc, including RedHat or CentOS 6.x and Blue
Gene.  On systems with an old glibc, use version 0.175.
