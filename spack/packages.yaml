#  packages.yaml
#
#  This file specifies the versions and variants for HPCToolkit's
#  dependency packages and serves as a common reference point for how
#  to build them.  It also specifies the paths or modules for system
#  build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid rebuilding them.
#
#  Put this file in one of spack's configuration scope directories,
#  normally either <spack-root>/etc/spack, or else in its own,
#  separate directory (and then use 'spack -C dir').
#
#  There are two main sections: (1) hpctoolkit dependency specs,
#  and (2) system build tools: cmake, perl, python, MPI and GCC.

packages:

  # If you want to specify a generic target or a specific compiler for
  # all builds, then you can set those here.  For example, a generic
  # target might be useful for a shared install acrosss multiple
  # machine types.
  # generic families: aarch64, ppc64, ppc64le, x86_64
  #
  # all:
  #   target: [x86_64]
  #   compiler: [gcc@7.4.0]


  #------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1 -- HPCToolkit Prerequisite Packages
  #------------------------------------------------------------

  # This section contains hpctoolkit's prerequisites, recommended
  # versions and necessary variants.  For most packages, the most
  # recent version will work.
  #
  # Note: the following packages have variants that may need changing
  # for your local system.
  #
  #   1. boost -- avoid 1.68.0, it breaks the build in hpctoolkit.
  #   1.66.0 is good for all dyninst revs.
  #
  #   2. dyninst -- use version 9.3.2 for Blue Gene with the default
  #   gcc 4.4 compilers.  (not recommended)
  #
  #   3. elfutils -- 0.176 doesn't build on Blue Gene, use 0.175.
  #
  #   4. intel-tbb -- add '~tm' for AMD, Xeon Phi (KNL, etc), and very
  #   old Intel systems that don't support transactional memory.
  #
  #   5. libmonitor -- add '+bgq' on Blue Gene/Q.
  #
  #------------------------------------------------------------


  # hpctoolkit -- these settings can be specified here or else on the
  # spack install command line.
  #
  # Use version 'master' for the latest snapshot from master.
  # 2019.12.28 is the last version that runs on Blue Gene.
  #
  # +mpi builds hpcprof-mpi (requires mpi).
  # +papi uses papi instead of perfmon.
  #
  # hpctoolkit:
  #   version:  [2020.06.12, master]
  #   variants: +mpi


  # binutils -- used by hpcprof and struct simple (for functions and
  # line map info) and for VMA types in various places.
  #
  # Best to use >= 2.32, earlier versions have a bug causing duplicate
  # function names in the viewer (from hpcprof and struct simple).
  #
  # +libiberty is needed for xmalloc functions in libbfd.
  # ~nls is needed to avoid linking with libintl from gettext.
  #
  binutils:
    version:  [2.33.1]
    variants: +libiberty ~nls


  # boost -- used by dyninst and now in hpcstruct.
  #
  # Dyninst requires >= 1.61.
  #   1.66.0 is good, works with all dyninst revs.
  #   1.70.0 requires dyninst >= 10.1.0 (breaks earlier revs).
  #   1.69.0 requires dyninst >= 10.0.0 (breaks earlier revs).
  #   1.68.0 breaks the build for hpctoolkit.
  #
  # +atomic, +chrono, etc are for dyninst.
  # +graph, +regex, etc are for toolkit proper.
  # ~mpi, ~python, etc are to reduce prereqs.
  # ~debug is to build release (optimized) variant.
  # visibility=global is required for recent hpctoolkit.

  #
  bzip2:
    version:  [1.0.8]
    variants: +shared


  # cuda -- nvidia cuda, now used in master.
  #
  # If there is a pre-built cuda for the system, then it may be better
  # to use that with a 'paths:' or 'modules:' entry.
  #
  # If installing here, then use >= 10.1 and check that the cuda

  #
  cuda:
    # modules:

  # +openmp is to support openmp threads in parseapi.
  #
  dyninst:
    version:  [10.1.0, develop]
    variants: +openmp build_type=RelWithDebInfo


  # elfutils -- used by dyninst for reading ELF sections.
  #
  # Dyninst requires >= 0.173 and we want a recent version for best
  # support for output from current compilers.  On Blue Gene, 0.176
  # doesn't build, so use 0.175.
  #
  # +bzip2, +xz are for reading compressed sections.
  # ~nls is needed to avoid linking with libintl from gettext.
  #

    variants: build_type=RelWithDebInfo


  # intel-tbb -- used by dyninst as part of parallel parsing.
  #
  # Dyninst requires >= 2018.6, most anything after that is good.
  #
  # Note: add ~tm for very old x86 or AMD or KNL systems that don't
  # support transactional memory (no-op on non-x86).
  #
  intel-tbb:
    version:  [2020.1]
    variants: +shared +tm


  # intel-xed -- used in various places to parse x86 instructions
  # (used on x86 only).
  #
  # Xed does not have releases, only git repo snapshots.  But Xed
  # changes pretty slowly.
  #
  # +debug adds debug symbols (-g).
  #
  intel-xed:
    version:  [2019.03.01]
    variants: +debug


  # libdwarf -- used in fnbounds for access to eh frames (not yet
  # available from elfutils).
  #
  # Normally want a recent version for best support for output from
  # current compilers.
  #
  libdwarf:
    version:  [20180129]


  # libiberty -- needed for dyninst configure (although dyninst 10.x
  # doesn't actually link with it).
  #
  # Any recent version is good.
  #
  # +pic is needed to link with dyninst shared library.
  #
  libiberty:
    version:  [2.33.1]
    variants: +pic


  # libmonitor -- used in hpcrun to provide access to an application's
  # processes and threads.

  # signals).
  #
  # Note: add +bgq on blue gene/q.
  #
  libmonitor:
    version:  [2019.05.31, master]
    variants: +hpctoolkit


  # libpfm4 (perfmon) -- used in hpcrun for access to the hardware
  # performance counters.
  #
  # If PAPI is available with the perfmon headers, then that
  # supersedes perfmon.  Otherwise, perfmon provides the perf sample
  # source but not PAPI.
  #
  # Normally want the latest version to support recent CPU types.
  #
  libpfm4:
    version:  [4.10.1]


  # libunwind -- used in hpcrun to help with unwinding.
  #
  # Normally, we need the most recent snapshot (not the default), or
  # else develop.  Use >= 1.4 (1.4-rc1 replaces 2018.10.12.)
  #
  # +xz is for reading compressed symbol tables.
  #
  libunwind:
    version:  [1.4.0, 1.5-rc1]
    variants: +xz


  # mbedtls -- now used in master.
  #

  #
  # +pic is required for linking with hpcrun.
  #
  mbedtls:
    version:  [2.16.1]
    variants: +pic


  # papi -- used in hpcrun for access to the hardware performance
  # counters.
  #
  # If there is a pre-built PAPI for the compute nodes, then it may be
  # better to use that and replace this with a 'paths:' or 'modules:'
  # entry (see the section on cmake).  But make sure that the PAPI
  # include directory contains the perfmon headers, or else you can't
  # use both PAPI and perfmon.
  #
  # If building, then use version >= 5.6.0 for the installed perfmon
  # headers.
  #
  papi:
    version:  [6.0.0.1]


  # xerces -- used in hpcprof to read XML.
  #
  # Any recent version is good.
  #
  # transcoder=iconv is needed to avoid linking with libiconv.
  #
  xerces-c:
    version:  [3.2.2]
    variants: transcoder=iconv


  # xz (lzma) -- used by elfutils and libunwind to read compressed
  # sections (and copy libs).
  #
  # Any recent version is good.
  #
  xz:
    version:  [5.2.4]


  # zlib -- used by binutils, elfutils and libdwarf to read compressed
  # sections (and copy libs).
  #
  # Zlib development is stagnant and 1.2.9 and 1.2.10 are buggy, so
  # 1.2.11 is the only recent version.
  #
  # +optimize is to add -O2.
  #
  zlib:
    version:  [1.2.11]
    variants: +optimize +shared


  #------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2 -- System Build Tools
  #------------------------------------------------------------

  # We require cmake >= 3.4, perl >= 5.x and python 2.7.x or 3.x.
  # There are three ways to satisfy these requirements: a system
  # installed version (eg, /usr), a module or build from scratch.
  #
  # By default, spack will rebuild these, even if your version is
  # perfectly fine.  If you already have an installed version and
  # prefer to use that instead, then uncomment some entry below and
  # edit to fit your system.
  #
  # Note: these three are all build tools.  They are needed to build
  # hpctoolkit, but we don't need them at run time or link with any
  # libraries.  (Not counting hpcsummary which is a python script.)
  #
  #------------------------------------------------------------


  # cmake -- dyninst requires cmake >= 3.4.x.

  # Example for a system install.  This example says that cmake 3.11.0
  # is available at /usr/bin/cmake.  Note: the 'paths:' entry is the
  # parent directory of 'bin', not the bin directory itself (similar
  # to prefix).
  # cmake:
  #   paths:
  #     cmake@3.11.0:  /usr
  #   buildable: False

  # Example for a module.  This example says that cmake 3.7.2 is
  # available from module 'CMake/3.7.2'.
  # cmake:
  #   modules:
  #     cmake@3.7.2:  CMake/3.7.2
  #   buildable: False

  # Example spec to build cmake from scratch.
  # +ownlibs, ~qt and ~openssl are to reduce prerequisites.
  # cmake:
  #   version:  [3.12.4]
  #   variants: +ownlibs ~qt ~openssl

  #------------------------------------------------------------

  # perl -- autotools requires perl >= 5.x which most systems have.

  # Example for system perl.
  # perl:
  #   paths:
  #     perl@5.16.3:  /usr
  #   buildable: False

  # Example spec to build perl.
  # perl:
  #   version:  [5.26.2]

  #------------------------------------------------------------

  # python -- spack always requires python >= 2.6 to do anything.
  # On x86, intel-xed requires python 2.7.x or >= 3.4.

  # Example for system python.
  # python:
  #   paths:
  #     python@2.7.5:  /usr
  #   buildable: False

  # Example for python module.
  # python:
  #   modules:
  #     python@2.7.15:  Python/2.7.15
  #   buildable: False

  # Example spec to build python.
  # ~dbm, ~tk are to reduce prerequisites.
  # python:
  #   version:  [2.7.15, 3.6.5]
  #   variants: ~dbm ~tk

  #------------------------------------------------------------

  # MPI -- hpctoolkit always supports profiling MPI applications.
  # Adding MPI here is only for building hpcprof-mpi, the MPI version
  # of hpcprof.
  #
  # Normally, you want MPI from a module (mpich, mvapich, openmpi)
  # that was built for the correct interconnect system for the compute
  # nodes.  Also, for hpcprof-mpi, MPI should be built with GNU
  # gcc/g++ and the same version used to build hpctoolkit (to keep the
  # C++ libraries in sync).
  #
  # openmpi:
  #   modules:
  #     openmpi@2.1.3:  OpenMPI/2.1.3
  #   buildable: False

  #------------------------------------------------------------

  # GCC -- hpctoolkit requires building with GNU gcc/g++.  We require
  # version 5.x or later.
  #
  # Spack handles compilers specially with the compilers.yaml file.
  # This example is only for building a more recent compiler.
  #
  # Note: spack will select the first version that is compatible with
  # the rest of the spec and command line.  So, put the version you
  # want to build first.  4.8.4 is really only for Blue Gene.

  # gcc:
  #   version:  [7.4.0, 6.4.0, 5.5.0, 4.8.4]
