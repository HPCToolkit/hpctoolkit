/// This is the main interface to the decoder.
///  @param xedd the decoded instruction of type #xed_decoded_inst_t . Mode/state sent in via xedd; See the #xed_state_t
///  @param itext the pointer to the array of instruction text bytes
///  @param bytes  the length of the itext input array. 1 to 15 bytes, anything more is ignored.
///  @return #xed_error_enum_t indiciating success (#XED_ERROR_NONE) or failure. Note failure can be due to not
///  enough bytes in the input array.
///
/// The maximum instruction is 15B and XED will tell you how long the
/// actual instruction is via an API function call
/// xed_decoded_inst_get_length().  However, it is not always safe or
/// advisable for XED to read 15 bytes if the decode location is at the
/// boundary of some sort of protection limit. For example, if one is
/// decoding near the end of a page and the XED user does not want to cause
/// extra page faults, one might send in the number of bytes that would
/// stop at the page boundary. In this case, XED might not be able to
/// decode the instruction and would return an error. The XED user would
/// then have to decide if it was safe to touch the next page and try again
/// to decode with more bytes.  Also sometimes the user process does not
/// have read access to the next page and this allows the user to prevent
/// XED from causing process termination by limiting the memory range that
/// XED will access.
