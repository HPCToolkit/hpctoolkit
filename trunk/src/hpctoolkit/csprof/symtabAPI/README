        *** Symtab 2.0 Release Notes ***

This is the version 2.0 release of the Symtab API.  Currently, the API
library is available for the Sparc/Solaris, POWER/AIX, x86/Linux,
x86/Windows XP/2000/2003, Alpha/Tru64 Unix, ia64/Linux, x86_64/Linux,
ppc32/linux and ppc64/linux platforms.

Documentation for the Symtab API can be found at:

    http://www.dyninst.org/

The src/core/symtabAPI/tests directory contains the source code for programs
that test the API functions.  These programs are useful as examples of how
to use the API.  See the README file in that directory for how to run or
rebuild them.

Setting up the environment
--------------------------

Before compiling or using the Symtab API library, you should set the
environment variables PLATFORM and DYNINST_ROOT.  PLATFORM should be set to
one of the following values depending upon what operating system you are
running on:

    i386-unknown-linux2.4	Linux 2.4/2.6 on an Intel x86 processor
    i386-unknown-nt4.0		Windows XP/2000/2003 on an Intel x86 processor
    ia64-unknown-linux2.4	Linux 2.4/2.6 on an IA-64 processor
    rs6000-ibm-aix5.1		AIX Version 5.1
    sparc-sun-solaris2.9	Solaris 2.9 on a SPARC processor
    ppc32-linux             Linux 2.4/2.6 on an ppc-32 processor
    ppc64-linux             Linux 2.4/2.6 on an ppc-64 processor
    x86_64-unknown-linux2.4     Linux 2.4/2.6 on an AMD-64 processor

DYNINST_ROOT should be set to the pathname of the top of the library
directory tree (symtabAPI).

On Unix-based systems, you will also need to add
$DYNINST_ROOT/$PLATFORM/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable (LIBPATH on AIX).  On Windows, you will instead need to add
%DYNINST_ROOT%/i386-unknown-nt4.0/lib to your PATH environment
variable.  This is so that mutator applications can be linked
dynamically with the Symtab library.

Notes on Using Symtab with Linux
---------------------------------

On Linux, Symtab requires some libraries that are not installed by default
in most distributions.  The first is libelf, which is included with most
distributions and can be installed using the distribution's package manager.
The second is libdwarf.  You can get the latest source code distribution
of libdwarf from http://reality.sgiweb.org/davea/.  RPM files for libdwarf
are also available from various sites.  Lastly, for IA-64, libunwind must
be installed, which can be found at 
http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/libunwind/.

Building the Symtab API from source
------------------------------------

If you downloaded the source distribution of this package, you can build the
Symtab API libraries by running "make" in the core directory (one level up
from where this README file is located), assuming your environment is set up
as described above.  On Unix platforms, you must use GNU make.  The top-level
makefile contains directives for compiling the Paradyn parallel performance
tool, from which the Symtab API was derived.  If you have downloaded only the
SymtabAPI, you will see a number of messages about missing directories.
These directories are needed only for making Paradyn, so you should ignore
these messages.  If you downloaded the entire Paradyn distribution, you can
make only the API libraries by running "make SymtabAPI" in the core
directory.
