=============================================================================

This is is top level directory for the tree that contains all of the
HPCToolkit source code.

=============================================================================

Builds should be done in this directory.  The make system by default
will store files that result from builds in ${HPCTOOLKIT}/obj.
Successful builds will install results in ${HPCTOOLKIT}/bin.  For more
information on building, refer to the HPCToolkit documentation at
${HPCTOOLKIT}/doc/index.html.

Overview of source code:
--------------------

hpctools/    - Contains the code for individual tools in the HPCToolkit 
               toolset.

	      
  bloop/       - Driver and analysis files specific to the 'bloop'
                 tool.

  hpcquick/    - Perl code for 'hpcquick'
  
  hpcview/     - Driver and analysis files specific to the 'hpcview' tool.

  ptran/       - Perl code for 'ptran'

  xprof/       - Driver and support files specific to the 'xprof'
                 tool.

hpc_include/ - Contains general include files available for any 
include/       HPCToolkit src files (but not external libraries).  There 
               should be no associated object files or library for these
               includes.
               
hpc_lib/     - Contains libraries for use by HPCToolkit
lib/           (but not external tools).

  binutils    - A library that reads load modules and executables
                and processes them by section, procedure and
		instruction.  It is built upon GNU's binutils and
		uses the ISA library to for queries that require
		instruction decoding.  (Uses 'support' and 'ISA'.)
		
  ISA         - ISA implements an instruction set architecture,
                most significantly by decoding and providing
		information about machine instructions.  It
		knows nothing about a load module ('binutils').
		(Uses 'support'.)

  perl        - Perl modules for use with the perl scripts in 
                src/hpctools.

  support     - A support library that defines several generic data
                structures, file operations and support routines.
		This library is not dependent upon any other library.
		
  xml         - This simple library provides routines for reading
                and writing XML files in lieu of using Xerces.
                (These routines were created when 'bloop' and 'xprof'
                were separate from 'hpcview' but the library still may
                have a justified existence.)  (Uses 'support'.)

		     
external_lib/

  OpenAnalysis/ - Implements generic and specialized graphs used in
                  program analysis.  Among other things, implements a
	          control flow graph and Tarjan interval analysis.

  binutils/     - GNU's binutils.  Among other things, implements the
                  basic interface to a load module's contents, symbol
	          table and debugging information.

external_tools

  hvprof - This is a version of vprof (The Visual Profiler) that has
           been extended to generate output in a parsable format that can
           be read by 'hpcview'.  See external_tools/hvprof/README.hvprof
           for more information.
