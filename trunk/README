0. What is HPCToolkit
----------------------------------------

HPCToolkit is an integrated suite of tools for measurement and
analysis of program performance on computers ranging from multicore
desktop systems to the nation's largest supercomputers. HPCToolkit
provides accurate measurements of a program's work, resource
consumption, and inefficiency, correlates these metrics with the
program's source code, works with multilingual, fully optimized
binaries, has very low measurement overhead, and scales to large
parallel systems. HPCToolkit's measurements provide support for
analyzing a program execution cost, inefficiency, and scaling
characteristics both within and across nodes of a parallel system.

  N.B.: When contacting us or submitting a bug report, please tell us
  about the following:
  - System. E.g., operating system, architecture, PAPI, compiler.
  - HPCToolkit. E.g., version; build information from
    <hpctoolkit-build>/config.log, which is generated after running
    configure.
  - Profiled application: E.g., language, whether dynamically or
    statically linked.
  - Relevant profiling/analysis commands. If you have used hpcrun,
    please include the results of executing:
      hpcsummary --all <hpctoolkit-measurements>
