0. What is HPCToolkit
---------------------

HPCToolkit is a multi-platform package with tools for 1) measuring 
the performance of fully-optimized parallel programs using statistical 
sampling, 2) analyzing application performance to identify performance
bottlenecks, 3) mapping performance information back to program source
code, and 4) synthesizing a browable representation that includes
performance metrics and source code.

HPCToolkit is a project of the Center for High Performance Software
Research (HiPerSoft) at Rice University.

Currently, the development of HPCToolkit is being supported by 
the Department of Energy's Office of Science through two projects in
the SciDAC program: the Performance Engineering Research Institute and
the Center for Scalable Application Development Software.
In the past, development of HPCToolkit was supported in part by 
the Los Alamos Computer Science Institute, the Department of Energy 
Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (LLNL Subcontract B347884), 
the Department of Defense CEWES ERDC MSRC Programming Environment and 
Training program, and the National Computational Science Alliance.

1. Getting HPCToolkit
---------------------

The HPCToolkit project, including subversion repository and bug
tracking system, is hosted at the SciDAC Outreach Center.

   https://outreach.scidac.gov/projects/hpctoolkit/

The HPCToolkit source files come in two trees: one for HPCToolkit
proper and one for all of its prerequisites.  Both are available via
anonymous subversion checkout.  The normal usage is to download (or
unpack) both trees in side-by-side directories.

   svn co https://outreach.scidac.gov/svn/hpctoolkit/externals
   svn co https://outreach.scidac.gov/svn/hpctoolkit/trunk hpctoolkit

Note that SciDAC uses https for anonymous checkout.

2. Building HPCToolkit
----------------------

See the file README.Externals for directions on building HPCToolkit
and its externals prerequisites.
