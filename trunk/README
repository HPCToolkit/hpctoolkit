0. What is HPCToolkit:
--------------------

HPCToolkit is a multi-platform package with tools for 1) collecting raw
profile information, 2) converting various types of profiling
information into platform independent XML formats and 3) synthesizing
browsable representations that correlate performance metrics gathered
from multiple sources with program source code.  It was formerly
released under the name HPCView.

HPCToolkit is an effort of the Center for High Performance Software
Research (HiPerSoft) at Rice University.

Development was supported in part though the Department of Energy
Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (LLNL Subcontract B347884),
the Department of Defense CEWES ERDC MSRC Programming Environment and
Training program, the Los Alamos Computer Science Institute, and the
National Computational Science Alliance.
