\Prog{hpcprof} correlates `flat' execution profiles with source code procedures and lines and generates plain-text or HTML output.
It is based on Curtis Janssen's VProf.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Description}

\Prog{hpcprof} correlates `flat' execution profiles of \Arg{binary} with source code procedures and lines and generates plain-text or HTML output.
\Arg{hpcrun-file} is a collection of event-based program counter histograms obtained using \Cmd{hpcrun}{1} (or \Cmd{hpcex}{1}).

\Prog{hpcprof} can generate the following information.  The term \emph{native} event refers to an event for which there is a program counter histogram.
\begin{Description}
  \item[totals] Total sample counts for each native event.  If the same native event name appears more than once, min/max/sum \emph{derived} events are computed.
  \item[load-module-summary] For each \emph{native} event (in order), show the exclusive percentage (or number) of samples attributed to each load module in \Arg{binary}
  \item[file-summary] For each \emph{native} event (in order), show the exclusive percentage (or number) of samples attributed to each $<$load module$>$$<$source file$>$ pair.
  \item[function-summary] For each \emph{native} event (in order), show the exclusive percentage (or number) of samples attributed $<$load module$>$$<$function$>$ pair.
  \item[line-summary] For each \emph{native} event (in order), show the exclusive percentage (or number) of samples attributed $<$load module$>$$<$file$>$$<$line$>$ triple.
\end{Description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Arguments}

\begin{Description}
\item[\Arg{binary}] An executable binary.
\item[\Arg{hpcrun-file}...] A non-empty list of \Arg{hpcrun-file}s.
\end{Description}

Default values for an option's optional arguments are shown in \{\}.

\subsection{Options: General}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptArg{-d}{dir}, \OptArg{--directory}{dir}] Search \Arg{dir} for source files.
\item[\OptArg{-D}{dir}, \OptArg{--recursive-directory}{dir}] Search \Arg{dir} recursively for source files.
\item[\Opt{--force}] Show data that is not accurate.
\item[\Opt{-V}, \Opt{--version}] Print version information.
\item[\Opt{-h}, \Opt{--help}] Print help.
\item[\OptArg{--debug}{n}]   Debug: use debug level \Arg{n}.
\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: Plain-text and HTML Output}
\begin{Description}
  \item[\Opt{-e}, \Opt{--everything}] Show all information listed above.
  \item[\Opt{-f}, \Opt{--files}] Show file-summary described above.
  \item[\Opt{-r}, \Opt{--funcs}] Show function-summary described above.
  \item[\Opt{-l}, \Opt{--lines}] Show line-summary described above.

  \item[\Opt{-n}, \Opt{--number}] Show number of samples instead of percentage
  \item[\OptArg{-s}{n}, \OptArg{--show}{n}] Use threshold \Arg{n} for showing aggregate data

  \item[\OptArg{-H}{dir}, \OptArg{--html}{dir}] Output HTML into directory \Arg{dir}
  \item[\OptArg{-a}{file}, \OptArg{--annotate}{file}] Annotate the source file \Arg{file}
\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: PROFILE Output}
\begin{Description}
  \item[\Opt{-p}, \Opt{--profile}] Generate PROFILE output to stdout. Note: This option is deprecated; use \Cmd{hpcquick}{1}/\Cmd{hpcview}{1} for improved correlation.
\end{Description}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Examples}

Assume we have collected flat profiling information using \Cmd{hpcrun}{1} \Cmd{hpcex}{1}).  Let the profile be named \File{}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item 

 and that we wish to correlate the profile with source lines.
We wish to recover program structure in the file \File{sweep3dsingle.psxml} for use with \Cmd{hpcquick}{1}/\Cmd{hpcview}{1}.
To do this, execute:
\begin{verbatim}
    bloop sweep3dsingle > sweep3dsingle.psxml
\end{verbatim}

%\end{enumerate}
