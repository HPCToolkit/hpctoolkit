\begin{Name}{1}{hpcprof}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{hpcprof:\\ Correlation of Call Path Profile Metrics with Static Program Structure}

\Prog{hpcprof} correlates dynamic call path profile metrics with static source code structure.  See \HTMLhref{hpctoolkit.html}{\Cmd{hpctoolkit}{1}} for an overview of \textbf{HPCToolkit}.

\end{Name}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Synopsis}

\Prog{hpcuick} \oOpt{other-options}
               \oOptArg{-I}{dir}
               \oOptArg{-S}{struct-file}
               \Arg{profile-file...}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Description}

\Prog{hpcprof} correlates dynamic profiling metrics with static source code structure and (by default) generates an Experiment database for use with \HTMLhref{hpcviewer.html}{\Cmd{hpcviewer}{1}}....

For best results, two other options should be used: \textbf{-I} to provide paths for source code directories and \textbf{-S} to provide source code structure from \HTMLhref{hpcstruct.html}{\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Arguments}

\subsection{Options: Correlation}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptArg{-I}{path}] A path (relative or absolute) containing source code to which performance data should be correlated.  In order to search a directory \emph{and} recursively search all of its descendents, append an escaped `*' after the last slash, e.g., \verb+/mypath/\*+ (escaping is for the shell). May be passed multiple times.
\item[\OptArg{-S}{struct-file}] A structure file (from \HTMLhref{hpcstruct.html}{\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}}) for the main program and/or any or all of the shared libraries used by the program.  May be passed multiple times.
\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: General}

\begin{Description}
\item[\Opt{-V}] Print version information.
\item[\Opt{-h}] Print help.
\end{Description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Examples}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item 

Assume we have collected \HTMLhref{hpcrun.html}{\Cmd{hpcrun}{1}} data for a run of \texttt{poissonSolve3d}.  Further assume we have used \HTMLhref{hpcstruct.html}{\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}} to compute program structure and stored the result in \texttt{poissonSolve3d.psxml}.  Source code for the application is located under the relative paths \verb+../lib+ and \verb+../example+.  \Prog{hpcprof} can be used to generate an Experiment database:
\begin{verbatim}
   hpcprof -I ../lib/\* -I ../example/\* -S poissonSolve3d.psxml -P poissonSolve3d.Linux.icpc.ifort.ex.PAPI_L2_DCM-etc.andre1.2150.0x866
\end{verbatim}
