\begin{Name}{1}{hpcprof}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{hpcprof:\\ Correlation of Call Path Profile Metrics with Static Program Structure}

\Prog{hpcprof} correlates dynamic call path profile metrics with static source code structure.  See \HTMLhref{hpctoolkit.html}{\Cmd{hpctoolkit}{1}} for an overview of \textbf{HPCToolkit}.

\end{Name}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Synopsis}

\Prog{hpcprof} \oOpt{options} \Arg{profile-dir-or-file}...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Description}

\Prog{hpcprof} correlates call path profiling metrics with static source code structure and generates an Experiment database for use with \HTMLhref{hpcviewer.html}{\Cmd{hpcviewer}{1}}.
It expects a list of call path profile directories or files.

For best results, two other options should be used: \textbf{-I} to provide paths for source code directories and \textbf{-S} to provide source code structure from \HTMLhref{hpcstruct.html}{\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Arguments}

\begin{Description}
\item[\Arg{profile-file...}] A list of flat profile files.
\end{Description}

Default values for an option's optional arguments are shown in \{\}.

\subsection{Options: General}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptoArg{-v}{n}, \OptoArg{--verbose}{n}]
Verbose: generate progress messages to stderr at verbosity level \Arg{n}.  \{1\} 
\item[\Opt{-V}, \Opt{--version}]
Print version information.

\item[\Opt{-h}, \Opt{--help}]
Print help.

\item[\OptoArg{--debug}{n}]
Debug: use debug level \Arg{n}. \{1\}
\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: Source Structure Correlation}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptArg{--name}{name}, \OptArg{--title}{name}]
Set the database's name (title) to \Arg{name}.

\item[\OptArg{-I}{path}, \OptArg{--include}{path}] 
Use \Arg{path} when searching for source files. For a recursive search, append a '*' after the last slash, e.g., \verb+'/mypath/*'+ (quote or escape to protect from the shell). May pass multiple times.

\item[\OptArg{-S}{file}, \OptArg{--structure}{file}] 
Use \HTMLhref{hpcstruct.html}{\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}} structure file \Arg{file} for correlation.  May pass multiple times (e.g., for shared libraries).
\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: Output}

\begin{Description}
  \item[\OptArg{-o}{db-path}, \OptArg{--db}{db-path}, \OptArg{--output}{db-path}] Specify Experiment database name \Arg{db-path}.  \{\File{./hpctoolkit-<app>-database}\}
