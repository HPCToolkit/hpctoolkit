HPCTOOLKIT can pinpoint and quantify scalability bottlenecks in fully optimized parallel programs with a measurement overhead of only a few percent. Recently, new capabilities were added to HPCTOOLKIT for collecting call path profiles for fully optimized codes without any compiler support, pinpointing and quantifying bottlenecks in multithreaded programs, exploring performance information and source code using a new user interface, and displaying hierarchical space-time diagrams based on traces of asynchronous call path samples. This paper provides an overview of HPCTOOLKIT and illustrates its utility for performance analysis of parallel applications.},

HPCToolkit: Top-down analysis of node performance Nathan Tallent (in conjunction with John Mellor-Crummey, Robert Fowler, Gabriel Marin,and Nathan Froyd of the Rice Parallel Compilers Group)

It is increasingly difficult for complex scientific programs to attain a significant fraction of peak performance on systems that are based on microprocessors with substantial instruction-level parallelism and deep memory hierarchies. Despite this trend, performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers.

To a large extent, existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use. To address these issues, we developed HPCToolkit - a toolkit for 1) collecting profile data from unmodified optimized binaries, 2) recovering a binary's static structure (esp. loop nests), 3) correlating performance metrics with program structure and synthesizing derived metrics that cannot be directly measured, and 4) generating a high-level view of performance information that is correlated with program source code and presented in a graphical user interface that enables intuitive, interactive, top-down exploration of results. We present an overview of HPCToolkit and argue that it addresses many of the issues that have limited the usability and the utility of most existing tools.

All tools in HPCToolkit are open source and multi-platform. They are currently in use on LANL's HP/Compaq Alphaserver+Quadrics cluster (Alpha+Tru64), SGI Origin (MIPS+Irix), Rice's HP Itanium2+Myrinet cluster (Itanium+Linux), along with Pentium-based desktops running Linux.
