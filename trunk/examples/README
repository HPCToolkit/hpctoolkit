This directory contains some sample scripts and configuration files
that are useful illustrations of how to go beyond the capabilities 
provided by hpcquick.

See the individual files for more information.  Before using, we
highly recommend that you copy each set of script and configurations
files that you wish to try into a new temporary directory.  You will
then be able to modify the files and generate profiling data/files
without interfering with unrelated files.
