@section Introduction

These notes describe how to build and install HPCToolkit and hpcviewer
and their prerequisites with Spack.  HPCToolkit proper (hpcrun,
hpcstruct and hpcprof) is used to measure and analyze an application's
performance and then produce a database for hpcviewer.  HPCToolkit is
supported on the following platforms.

@enumerate
@item
Linux (64-bit) on x86_64, big and little-endian powerpc (power7, 8 and
9) and ARM (aarch64).

@item
Cray XT/XE/XK/XC on x86_64 and Compute Node Linux.

@item
IBM Blue Gene/Q on ppc64 (now deprecated).
@end enumerate

@noindent
We provide binary distributions for hpcviewer and hpctraceviewer on
Linux (x86_64 and powerpc), Windows and MacOS.  HPCToolkit databases are
platform-independent and it is common to run hpcrun on one machine and
then view the results on another machine.

We build HPCToolkit and its prerequisite libraries from source.
HPCToolkit has some 15-20 prerequisites and we now use spack to build
them.  It is possible to use spack to install all of hpctoolkit or
build just the prerequisites and then build hpctoolkit with the
traditional @code{configure ; make ; make install} method from
autotools.  Developers will probably want to run @code{configure} and
@code{make} manually, but both methods are supported.

Note: the old method of using hpctoolkit-externals to build the
prerequisite libraries is now superseded by spack.  Although externals
will continue to work for a while, we have stopped updating externals
and now add newer versions of packages only in spack.

These notes are written mostly from the view of using spack to build
hpctoolkit and its dependencies.  If you are a more experienced spack
user, especially if you want to use spack to build hpctoolkit plus
several other packages, then you will want to adapt these directions to
your own needs.

Spack documentation is available at:

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Prerequisites

Building HPCToolkit requires the following prerequisites.

@enumerate
@item
The GNU gcc and g++ compilers version 5.x or later.  On systems with
older compilers, you can use spack to build a later version of gcc.

@item
GNU glibc version 2.16 or later.  Note: Red Hat 6.x uses glibc 2.12
which is too old.

@item
Basic build tools: make, ld, ar, objcopy, nm, etc, and shell utilities:
bash, sed, awk, grep, etc.  Most Linux systems have these tools, or else
you couldn't compile anything.

@item
Cmake version 3.4 or later, perl version 5.x, and python version 2.7 or
3.4 or later.  On systems that are missing these tools or have versions
that are too old, you can use spack to build a later version.

@item
Git and curl for downloading files.

@item
(optional) Environment (TCL) or LUA (Lmod) modules, if you want to make
HPCToolkit available as a module.  Again, spack can install these
packages if they are missing from your system.
@end enumerate

@noindent
Hpcviewer and hpctraceviewer require Java version 8.  On Linux, the
viewers also require GTK+ version 2.x.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Spack Notation

Spack uses a special notation for specifying the version, variants,
compilers and dependencies when describing how to build a package.
This combination of version, variants, etc is called a 'spec' and is
used both on the command line and in config files.

@enumerate
@item
'@@' specifies the package version.  @code{spack info <package>} shows
the available versions and variants for a package.  In most cases,
spaces are optional between elements of a spec.  For example:

@example
boost@@1.66.0    dyninst @@10.1.0    hpctoolkit @@master
@end example

@item
'+', '-', '~' specify boolean (on/off) variants.  Note: @code{-}
(dash) and @code{~} (tilde) both mean 'off'.  Use dash after a space
and tilde after a non-space.  For example:

@example
elfutils+bzip2~nls    elfutils +bzip2 -nls    elfutils@@0.176 +bzip2~nls
@end example

@item
'name=value' specifies a non-boolean variant, for example:

@example
dyninst+openmp build_type=RelWithDebInfo    xerces-c@@3.2.2 transcoder=iconv
@end example

@item
'%' specifies the build compiler and its version, for example:

@example
hpctoolkit@@master %gcc@@7.3.0
@end example

@item
'cflags', 'cxxflags', 'fflags', 'cppflags', 'ldflags' and 'ldlibs' are
special name/value variants for compiler flags.  These are normally not
needed, but if you do need to add a flag to the build, then one example
might be:

@example
amg2013 cflags='-O2 -mavx512pf'
@end example

@item
'^' represents a dependency spec.  The spec for a dependency package is
a full spec and may include its own version, variants, etc.  For
example:

@example
hpctoolkit@@master ^dyninst@@10.1.0+openmp
@end example

@item
'arch', 'platform', 'os' and 'target' are special options for the system
architecture and machine type.  Platform is normally 'linux', or else
'cray' or 'bgq' (or even 'windows' or 'darwin').  OS is the Linux
distribution, 'rhel7', 'sles15', etc, and target is the machine type,
'x86_64', 'ppc64le', etc.  Arch is a triple of platform, os and target
separated by dashes.

Normally, a system has only one arch type and you don't need to
specify this.  However, for systems with separate front and back-end
types, the default is the back end.  For example, if you wanted to
build python for the front end on Cray, then you might use something
like this.

@example
python@@3.7.4 arch=cray-sles12-x86_64
@end example

@noindent
Also, now that spack has implemented microarchitecture targets
(haswell, ivybridge, etc), you can use 'target' to build for a generic
x86_64 or a specific CPU type.  For example:

@example
amg2013 target=x86_64    lulesh target=ivybridge
@end example
@end enumerate

@noindent
When writing a spec (for @code{spack install} or other), spack will
fully resolve all possible choices for the package and all of its
dependencies and create a unique hash value for that exact
configuration.  This process is called 'concretization.'  To see how
spack would concretize a spec, use @code{spack spec <partial-spec>}.

@example
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies}
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Clone Spack and HPCToolkit

Spack is available via git clone from GitHub.  This includes the core
spack machinery and recipes for building more than 4,200 packages (and
growing).  You should also clone HPCToolkit for the
@code{packages.yaml} file which is used to configure the spack build.

@example
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
git clone https://github.com/hpctoolkit/hpctoolkit.git
@end example

@noindent
After cloning, add the @code{spack/bin} directory to your PATH, or else
source the spack @code{setup-env} script.

@example
(bash)   .  /path/to/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
(csh)    setenv SPACK_ROOT /path/to/spack/root
         source $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.csh
@end example

@noindent
It suffices to add @code{spack/bin} to your PATH (or even symlink the
spack launch script).  Sourcing the @code{setup-env} script adds extra
support for modules built by spack.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Config.yaml

@code{config.yaml} is the top-level spack config file.  This specifies
the directory layout for installed files and the top-level spack
parameters.  There are two fields that you normally want to set,
especially if you want to install modules for hpctoolkit in a public
directory.  For a module to be available, both the @code{install_tree}
and @code{module_roots} directories must be accessible.

@enumerate
@item
@code{install_tree} -- by default, spack installs packages inside the
spack repository at @code{spack/opt/spack}.  If you want to use another
location, then set this.

@item
@code{module_roots} -- by default, spack installs module files inside
the spack repository at @code{spack/share/spack}.  If you want to use
another location, then set this.
@end enumerate

@noindent
There are two other fields that you may want to set for you local
system.

@enumerate 3
@item
@code{connect_timeout} -- some download sites, especially sourceforge
are often slow to connect.  If you find that connections are timing out,
then increase this time to 30 or 60 seconds (default is 10 seconds).

@item
@code{build_jobs} -- by default, spack uses all available hardware
threads for parallel make, up to a limit of 16.  If you're using a
shared machine and don't want to use the entire machine, then set this
to a smaller number.
@end enumerate

@noindent
There are also parameters for the locations of the build directories,
the cache of downloaded tar files, etc, which you may wish to set.

The default @code{config.yaml} file is in the spack repository at
@code{spack/etc/spack/defaults}.  The simplest solution is to copy this
file one directory up and then edit the copy (don't edit the default
file directly).

@example
cd spack/etc/spack
cp defaults/config.yaml .
vi config.yaml
@end example

@noindent
Alternatively, you could put this file in a separate directory, outside
of the spack repository and then use @code{-C dir} on the spack command
line.  (The @code{-C} option goes before the spack command name.)

@example
spack -C dir install ...
@end example

@noindent
Note: if you put @code{config.yaml} in @code{spack/etc/spack}, then it
will apply to every spack command for that repository (and you won't
forget).  Putting it in a separate directory is more flexible because
you can support multiple configurations from the same repository.  But
then you must use @code{-C dir} with every spack command or else you
will get inconsistent results.

You can view the current configuration with @code{spack config}.

@example
spack [-C dir] config get config
@end example

@noindent
See the spack docs on `Configuration Files' and `Basic Settings'.

@example
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html}
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_yaml.html}
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Packages.yaml

The @code{packages.yaml} file specifies the versions and variants for
the packages that spack installs and serves as a common reference
point for HPCToolkit's prerequisites.  This file also specifies the
paths or modules for system build tools (cmake, python, etc) to avoid
rebuilding them.  Put this file in the same directory as
@code{config.yaml}.  A sample @code{packages.yaml} file is available
in the @code{spack} directory of the hpctoolkit repository.

There are two main sections to @code{packages.yaml}.  The first
specifies the versions and variants for hpctoolkit's prereqs.  By
default, spack will choose the latest version of each package (plus
any constraints from hpctoolkit's @code{package.py} file).  In most
cases, this will work, but not always.  If you need to specify a
different version or variant, then set this in @code{packages.yaml}.

Note: the versions and variants specified in hpctoolkit's
@code{package.py} file are hard constraints and should not be changed.
Variants in @code{packages.yaml} are preferences that may be modified
for your local system.  (But don't report a bug until you have first
tried the versions from @code{packages.yaml} that we supply.)

There are at least two packages with a variant that you may need to
change depending on your system.  But always check the current
@code{packages.yaml} file to see if any more have been added.

@enumerate
@item
@code{intel-tbb} -- for very old Intel or AMD systems that don't support
transactional memory, change @code{+tm} to @code{~tm}.  (This option has
no effect on non-x86 systems.)

@item
@code{libmonitor} -- on Blue Gene/Q, add @code{+bgq}.
@end enumerate

@subsection External Packages

The second section in @code{packages.yaml} specifies a path or module
for system build tools.  Building hpctoolkit's prerequisites requires
cmake 3.4 or later, perl 5.x and python 2.7 or 3.4 or later.  There are
three ways to satisfy these requirements: a system installed version
(eg, /usr), a pre-built module or build from scratch.

By default, spack will rebuild these from scratch, even if your local
version is perfectly fine.  If you already have an installed version
and prefer to use that instead, then you can specify this in
@code{packages.yaml}.  Note that these are only build tools.
Hpctoolkit does not link with any of their libraries.

For example, this entry says that cmake 3.7.2 is available from module
@code{CMake/3.7.2} and that spack should use this instead of building
its own copy.

@example
cmake:
  modules:
    cmake@@3.7.2:  CMake/3.7.2
  buildable: False
@end example

@noindent
This example says that perl v5.16.3 is installed at
@code{/usr/bin/perl}.  Note that the @code{paths:} entry is the parent
directory of @code{bin}, not the bin directory itself (similar to
prefix).

@example
perl:
  paths:
    perl@@5.16.3:  /usr
  buildable: False
@end example

@subsection Micro-Architecture Targets

Spack implements a hierarchy of micro-architecture targets, where
'target' is a specific architecture (eg, haswell, ivybridge) instead of
a generic family (x86_64).  This allows the compiler to optimize code
for the specific target.

You will notice this choice in two main places: the 'spack spec' and the
path for the install directory.  For example, @code{linux-rhel7-x86_64}
might become @code{linux-rhel7-broadwell}.  You can use @code{spack
arch} to see the list of generic families and micro-architecture
targets.

@example
spack arch --known-targets
@end example

@noindent
If you prefer a generic install, you can use the @code{target} option to
specify a generic family instead of a micro-architecture target.  This
would be useful for a shared install that needs to work across multiple
machines with different micro-arch types.  For example:

@example
spack install hpctoolkit ... target=x86_64
@end example

@noindent
If you want to use this target for all spack builds, then you can
specify this in @code{packages.yaml}.  The generic families are: x86_64,
ppc64, ppc64le and aarch64.  For example:

@example
packages:
  all:
    target: [x86_64]
@end example

@noindent
See the spack docs on 'Build Customization' and 'Specs and
Dependencies'.

@example
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html}
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies}
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Compilers and compilers.yaml

Building HPCToolkit requires GNU gcc/g++ version 5.x or later.  By
default, spack uses the latest available version of gcc, but you can
specify a different compiler, if one is available.

Spack uses a separate file, @code{compilers.yaml} to store information
about available compilers.  This file is normally in your home directory
at @code{~/.spack/platform} where `platform' is normally `linux' (or
else `cray' or `bgq').

The first time you use spack, or after adding a new compiler, you should
run @code{spack compiler find} to have spack search your system for
available compilers.  If a compiler is provided as a module, then you
should load the module before running @code{find}.  Normally, you only
need to run @code{find} once, unless you want to add or delete a
compiler.  You can also run @code{spack compiler list} and @code{spack
compiler info} to see what compilers spack knows about.

For example, on one power8 system running RedHat 7.3, /usr/bin/gcc is
version 4.8.5, but gcc 6.4.0 is available as module @code{GCC/6.4.0}.

@example
module load GCC/6.4.0

spack compiler find
==> Added 2 new compilers to /home/krentel/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml
    gcc@@6.4.0  gcc@@4.8.5
==> Compilers are defined in the following files:
    /home/krentel/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml

spack compiler list
==> Available compilers
-- gcc rhel7-ppc64le --------------------------------------------
gcc@@6.4.0  gcc@@4.8.5

spack compiler info gcc@@6.4
gcc@@6.4.0:
    paths:
        cc = /opt/apps/software/Core/GCCcore/6.4.0/bin/gcc
        cxx = /opt/apps/software/Core/GCCcore/6.4.0/bin/g++
        f77 = /opt/apps/software/Core/GCCcore/6.4.0/bin/gfortran
        fc = /opt/apps/software/Core/GCCcore/6.4.0/bin/gfortran
    modules  = ['GCC/6.4.0']
    operating system  = rhel7
@end example

@noindent
Note: for compilers from modules, spack does not fill in the
@code{modules:} field in the @code{compilers.yaml} file.  You need to
do this manually.  In the above example, after running @code{find}, I
edited @code{compilers.yaml} to add @code{GCC/6.4.0} to the
@code{modules:} field as below.  This is important to how spack
manipulates the build environment.

@example
- compiler:
    modules: [GCC/6.4.0]
    operating_system: rhel7
    spec: gcc@@6.4.0
    ...
@end example

@noindent
Spack uses @code{%} syntax to specify the build compiler and @code{@@}
syntax to specify the version.  For example, suppose you had gcc
versions 7.3.1, 6.4.0 and 5.4.0 available and you wanted to use 6.4.0.
You could write this as:

@example
spack install package %gcc@@6.4.0
@end example

@noindent
See the spack docs on `Compiler Configuration'.

@example
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#compiler-configuration}
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Spack Install

First, set up your @code{config.yaml}, @code{packages.yaml} and
@code{compilers.yaml} files as above and edit them for your system.
You can see how spack will build hpctoolkit with @code{spack spec} and
@code{spack graph}.

@example
spack spec hpctoolkit
spack graph hpctoolkit
@end example

@noindent
Then, the ``one button'' method uses spack to install everything.

@example
spack install hpctoolkit
@end example

@noindent
@b{Tip:} Spack fetch is somewhat fragile and often has transient
problems downloading files.  You can use @code{spack fetch -D} to
pre-fetch all of the tar files and resolve any downloading problems
before starting the full install.

@example
spack fetch -D hpctoolkit
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Manual Install

The manual method uses spack to build hpctoolkit's prerequisites and
then uses the traditional autotools @code{configure && make && make
install} to install hpctoolkit.  This method is primarily for
developers who want to compile hpctoolkit, edit the source code and
recompile, etc.  This method is also useful if you need some configure
option that is not available through spack.

First, use spack to build hpctoolkit's prerequisites as above.  You
can either build some version of hpctoolkit as before (which will pull
in the prerequisites), or else use @code{--only dependencies} to avoid
building hpctoolkit itself.

@example
spack install --only dependencies hpctoolkit
@end example

@noindent
Then, configure and build hpctoolkit as follows.  Hpctoolkit uses
automake and so allows for parallel make.

@example
configure  \
   --prefix=/path/to/hpctoolkit/install/prefix  \
   --with-spack=/path/to/spack/install_tree/linux-fedora26-x86_64/gcc-7.3.1  \
   ...
make -j <num>
make install
@end example

@noindent
The argument to @code{--with-spack} should be the directory containing
all of the individual package directories, normally two directories
down from the top-level @code{install_tree} and named by the platform
and compiler.  This option replaces the old @code{--with-externals}.
The following are other options that may be useful.  For the full list
of options, see @code{configure -h}.

@enumerate
@item
@code{--enable-all-static} -- build hpcprof-mpi statically linked for
the compute nodes.

@item
@code{--enable-bgq} -- configure for Blue Gene/Q back end.

@item
@code{--enable-develop} -- compile with optimization turned off for
debugging.

@item
@code{--with-package=path} -- specify the install prefix for some
prerequisite package, mostly for developers who want to use a custom,
non-spack version of some package.

@item
@code{MPICXX=compiler} -- specify the MPI C++ compiler for
hpcprof-mpi, may be a compiler name or full path.
@end enumerate

@noindent
Note: if your spack install tree has multiple versions or variants for
the same package, then @code{--with-spack} will select the one with
the most recent directory time stamp (and issue a warning).  If this
is not what you want, then you will need to specify the correct
version with a @code{--with-package} option.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Advanced Options

@subsection CUDA

Beginning with the 2020.03.01 version, HPCToolkit now supports
profiling CUDA binaries (nVidia only).  For best results, use CUDA
version 10.1 or later and Dyninst 10.1 or later.  Note: in addition to
a CUDA installation, you also need the CUDA system drivers installed.
This normally requires root access and is outside the scope of spack.

For a spack install with CUDA, use the @code{+cuda} variant.

@example
spack install hpctoolkit +cuda
@end example

@noindent
For a manual install, either download and install CUDA or use an
existing module, and then use the @code{--with-cuda} configure option.

@example
configure  \
   --prefix=/path/to/hpctoolkit/install/prefix  \
   --with-spack=/path/to/spack/install/dir   \
   --with-cuda=/path/to/cuda/install/prefix  \
   ...
@end example

@noindent
If you installed CUDA with spack in the same directory as the rest of
the prerequisites, then the @code{--with-spack} option should find it
automatically (but check the summary at the end of the configure
output).  If you are using CUDA from a separate system module, then you
will need the @code{--with-cuda} option.

@subsection MPI

HPCToolkit always supports profiling MPI applications.  For
hpctoolkit, the spack variant @code{+mpi} is for building hpcprof-mpi,
the MPI version of hpcprof.  If you want to build hpcprof-mpi, then
you need to supply an installation of MPI.

Normally, for systems with compute nodes, you should use an existing
MPI module that was built for the correct interconnect for your system
and add this to @code{packages.yaml}.  The MPI module should be built
with the same version of GNU gcc/g++ used to build hpctoolkit (to keep
the C++ libraries in sync).

@subsection PAPI vs Perfmon

HPCToolkit can access the Hardware Performance Counters with either
PAPI or Perfmon (libpfm4).  By default, the hpctoolkit package uses
perfmon.  If you want to use PAPI instead, then build hpctoolkit with
@code{+papi}.  However, you can't use both due to a potential conflict
in their header files.

PAPI runs on top of the perfmon library, but PAPI uses its own,
internal copy of perfmon.  Prior to version 5.6.0, PAPI did not
install the perfmon header files, so it was impossible to access the
perfmon events through PAPI.

However, starting with version 5.6.0, PAPI now installs both the
perfmon library and its header files.  Hpctoolkit configure will
automatically detect this, so if you build hpctoolkit with a recent
enough version of PAPI, then both the PAPI and perfmon interfaces will
be available.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Platform Specific Notes

@subsection Blue Gene

Support for Blue Gene/Q is now deprecated and versions 2020.03.01 and
later will no longer build.  If you want to install HPCToolkit on Blue
Gene, then use spack version 2019.12.28 or git commit 0d91fb34edb2
with gcc 4.8.x and follow the directions below.  These directions will
also work (without Blue Gene) for Red Hat 6.x (glibc 2.12 is too old
to support current hpctoolkit).

Blue Gene systems are being phased out, without a next generation
replacement, but are still supported by hpctoolkit (for now).  Blue
Gene normally comes with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.x front
end and the GNU gcc/g++ 4.4 compilers with are too old to support the
latest version of hpctoolkit.

Spack supports two architecture types on Blue Gene.  The front-end arch
is @code{bgq-rhel6-ppc64} and the back-end arch is @code{bgq-cnk-ppc64}.
Normally, it would matter whether we built for the front end or back
end.  But for the GNU compilers on Blue Gene, both compilers are
/usr/bin/gcc.  So, we just build for the default back end.

There are two ways to build hpctoolkit for Blue Gene, depending on the
version of the compiler and Dyninst.  The simple method uses the default
GCC 4.4 compiler and Dyninst 9.3.2.  Edit these two entries in the
@code{packages.yaml} file.

@enumerate
@item
Set the dyninst version to @code{9.3.2}.

@item
Add @code{+bgq} to the libmonitor variants.
@end enumerate

@noindent
Then, build hpctoolkit with @code{+bgq} turned on.  The @code{+bgq}
variant adds MPI and hpcprof-mpi and supersedes the @code{+mpi}
variant.

@example
spack install hpctoolkit +bgq
@end example

@noindent
The advanced method involves building a new compiler (gcc 4.8 or 4.9)
but allows using Dyninst 10.x.  This method requires TCL or Lmod
modules and an MPI C++ compiler built for a compatible version of g++.
Mira and vesta at ANL have softenv modules for +mpiwrapper-gcc and
+bgqtoolchain-gcc484 but don't provide TCL or Lmod modules.

First, use spack to build a new compiler.  Dyninst 10.x requires
gcc@w{ }4.8 or later, but libmonitor requires the true back-end
@code{powerpc64-bgq-linux-gcc} compiler which is version 4.4.  We
settle on gcc 4.8.5 as a compromise between these two constraints.
Edit @code{config.yaml} to set @code{module_roots} to a directory in
which to install the modules and then build gcc.

@example
spack install gcc @@4.8.5
@end example

@noindent
Assuming you have modules installed, then load the new gcc module and
rerun @code{spack compiler find}.  This should add the new compiler to
your @code{compilers.yaml} file (twice, for front and back end).  For
example, on vulcan at LLNL,

@example
module use /path/to/modules/bgq-cnk-ppc64
module load gcc-4.8.5-gcc-4.4.7-nzvjwva
spack compiler find
==> Added 2 new compilers to /g/g21/krentel1/.spack/bgq/compilers.yaml
    gcc@@4.8.5  gcc@@4.8.5
@end example

@noindent
Note: after running @code{spack compiler find}, you still need to add
the modules field to the compiler entry in @code{compilers.yaml} as in
the section on Compilers.

Note: in the above example, we used gcc 4.4.7 to build gcc 4.8.5 (so
the gcc-4.8.5 package is in the gcc-4.4.7 directory).  You could then
use gcc 4.8.5 to rebuild 4.8.5, if you like, but this is not
necessary.

Finally, use the new compiler to build hpctoolkit with the new compiler.
If you have modified the dyninst entry in @code{packages.yaml}, then
reset the dyninst version to 10.1.0 (or later).

@example
spack install hpctoolkit +bgq %gcc@@4.8.5
@end example

@noindent
If you don't have modules installed, then use @code{spack bootstrap}
to build the environment-modules package.  Then, source the bash or
csh script in the @code{Modules/init} directory to add the
@code{module} function to your environment.  For example,

@example
spack bootstrap
cd /path/to/environment-modules-4.2.4-rwtvlanuss35fxd3xuyldbfopt2m4ecs/init
(bash)  . ./bash
(csh)   source ./csh
@end example

@noindent
Alternatively, you could try adding the module environment variables
(PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH) manually, but then you may have to run
spack install with @code{--dirty}.  The @code{--dirty} option tells
spack not to erase LD_LIBRARY_PATH while building packages.

@example
spack install --dirty hpctoolkit +bgq %gcc@@4.8.5
@end example

@noindent
For developers, if you are building hpctoolkit directly (outside of
spack) but using spack prerequisites, then use a configure line
similar to the following.

@example
configure  \
    --prefix=/path/to/install/prefix  \
    --with-spack=/path/to/bgq-cnk-ppc64/gcc-4.8.5  \
    --enable-bgq  \
    --enable-all-static  \
    MPICXX=mpicxx
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsection Cray

Cray systems, like Blue Gene, have separate front and back-end
architecture types.  For example, on theta at ANL, the front-end arch
is @code{cray-sles12-haswell} (SuSE Linux version 12 for haswell) and
the back-end is @code{cray-cnl6-mic_knl} (Compute Node Linux for KNL).

Hpctoolkit needs to be built with the GNU Programming Environment and
the front-end x86_64 compilers, plus the @code{CC} MPI C++ wrapper.
Switch to the @code{PrgEnv-gnu} module and unload the darshan module.
Darshan is a profiling tool that monitors an application's use of I/O,
but it conflicts with hpctoolkit.

@example
module swap PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu
module unload darshan
@end example

@noindent
By default, spack does not correctly identify the gcc compiler modules
as front-end compilers.  Start by loading a recent gcc module (eg, 7.x
or 8.x) and try running @code{spack compiler find} and @code{spack
compiler list}.  For example on theta at ANL,

@example
module load gcc/8.3.0
spack compiler find /opt/gcc/8.3.0

spack compiler list
==> Available compilers
-- gcc cnl6-any -------------------------------------------------
gcc@@8.3.0  gcc@@8.1.0  gcc@@7.2.0  gcc@@6.3.0  gcc@@5.3.0
gcc@@8.2.0  gcc@@7.3.0  gcc@@7.1.0  gcc@@6.1.0  gcc@@4.9.3

-- gcc sles12-x86_64 --------------------------------------------
gcc@@8.3.0  gcc@@4.8
@end example

@noindent
If spack identifies the compiler (as above), then great.  Note that we
need spack to accept this as a front-end compiler (sles12-x86_64), not
just for the back end (cnl6-any).  If spack doesn't find the compiler
automatically, then you need to add it manually.  Edit
@code{~/.spack/cray/compilers.yaml} and add an entry similer to the
following (your versions may differ).

@example
- compiler:
    environment: @{@}
    flags: @{@}
    modules:
    - PrgEnv-gnu/6.0.5
    - gcc/8.3.0
    - craype/2.6.1
    - cray-mpich/7.7.10
    operating_system: sles12
    paths:
      cc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gcc
      cxx: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/g++
      f77: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
      fc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
    spec: gcc@@8.3.0
    target: x86_64
@end example

@noindent
Regardless of whether spack created the entry or you added it, you still
need to add the @code{modules:} field manually (be sure to include all
four modules).  Although it takes several steps to create the correct
entry, the good news is that it should continue to work as long as the
underlying module exists.

Next, review your @code{packages.yaml} file.  On Cray systems with Xeon
Phi back-end nodes (KNL, KNH, etc), add @code{~tm} to intel-tbb to
disable transactional memory.

Finally, build hpctoolkit with the front-end arch type (eg,
cray-sles12-x86_64) and option @code{+cray}.  Normally, you can use OS
type @code{fe} (front-end) in place of @code{sles12}.  As with Blue
Gene, the @code{+cray} option adds MPI and hpcprof-mpi and supersedes
the @code{+mpi} variant.

@example
spack install hpctoolkit +cray arch=cray-fe-x86_64
@end example

@noindent
On some systems, spack fails to properly load the compiler modules
during the build and fails during hpctoolkit configure with an error
about, ``MPICXX is not a valid compiler.''  In this case, make sure that
you have the PrgEnv-gnu and gcc modules loaded and retry the install
with @code{--dirty}.

@example
spack install --dirty hpctoolkit +cray arch=cray-fe-x86_64
@end example

@noindent
For developers, if you are building hpctoolkit directly (outside of
spack) but using spack prerequisites, then use a configure line
similar to the following.

@example
configure  \
    --prefix=/path/to/install/prefix  \
    --with-spack=/path/to/cray-sles12-x86_64/gcc-8.3.0  \
    --enable-all-static  \
    MPICXX=CC
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Hpcviewer and Hpctraceviewer

We provide binary distributions for hpcviewer and hpctraceviewer on
Linux (x86_64 and powerpc), Windows and MacOS.  HPCToolkit databases are
platform-independent and it is common to run hpcrun on one machine and
then view the results on another machine.

All versions of the viewers require Java version 8 (not 9 or later).
The Linux versions also require GTK+ version 2.x.

@subsection Spack Install

The spack install is available on Linux x86_64, big-endian power7
(ppc64) and little-endian power8 and 9 (ppc64le).  This installs both
hpcviewer and hpctraceviewer and includes the Java 8 prerequisite.

On x86_64, use either jdk or openjdk.  The latest 1.8 jdk package,
1.8.0_202 has trouble downloading due to licensing issues, however
1.8.0_141-b15 seems to work.  (Or, you could manually download jdk
1.8.0_202 and copy it to the spack file cache.)  For openjdk, use
version 1.8.0_202-b08.

@example
spack install hpcviewer ^jdk@@1.8.0_141-b15
spack install hpcviewer ^openjdk@@1.8.0_202-b08
@end example

@noindent
On powerpc (big and little-endian), use the IBM version of Java.

@example
spack install hpcviewer ^ibm-java
@end example

@subsection Manual Install

Binary distributions of the viewers for all supported platforms are
available at:

@example
@uref{http://hpctoolkit.org/download/hpcviewer}
@end example

@noindent
On Linux, download the @code{linux.gtk} versions of hpcviewer and
hpctraceviewer, unpack the tar files and run the install scripts (for
both viewers) with the path to the desired install prefix.

@example
./install /path/to/install/directory
@end example

@noindent
On Windows and MacOS, download the @code{win32} or @code{macosx.cocoa}
versions and unpack the zip files in the desired directory.  Due to
Apple's security precautions, on MacOS, you will need to use curl or
wget instead of a web browser.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Building a New Compiler

Some systems may have compilers that are too old for building
HPCToolkit or other packages.  For example, RedHat 7.x comes with gcc
4.8.x which is very old.  If your system doesn't already have modules
for later compilers, then you may need to build a new compiler
yourself.

First, pick a directory in which to install the modules and make
subdirectories for the spack packages and module files.  In this
example, I'm using @code{/opt/spack/Modules} as my top-level directory
and subdirectories @code{packages} and @code{modules}.  Edit
@code{config.yaml} to add these paths.

@example
config:
  install_tree:  /opt/spack/Modules/packages

  # just use one of these
  module_roots:
    tcl:  /opt/spack/Modules/modules
    lmod: /opt/spack/Modules/modules
@end example

@noindent
Determine if your system uses TCL (environment) or Lmod modules.
Normally, the @code{module} command is a shell function.  TCL modules
use @code{modulecmd} and Lmod modules eval @code{LMOD_CMD}.  Edit
@code{modules.yaml} to enable the module type for your system.  Again,
you only need one of these (and don't use dotkit unless you work at
LLNL).

@example
modules:
  enable:
   - tcl
   - lmod
@end example

@noindent
Then, choose a version of gcc and use the default compiler (normally
@code{/usr/bin/gcc}) to build the newer version.  Currently, gcc 7.x
is a good choice that builds robustly, has enough modern features but
is not too new to cause problems for some packages.  For example,

@example
spack install gcc@@7.4.0
@end example

@noindent
Note: it is not necessary to rebuild the new compiler with itself.

@subsection Using the New Compiler

After building a new compiler, then you need to tell spack how to find
it.  First, use @code{module use} and @code{module load} to load the
module.  For TCL modules, the module files are in a subdirectory of
@code{module_roots} named after the system architecture.  For example,

@example
module use /opt/spack/Modules/modules/linux-rhel7-x86_64
module load gcc-7.4.0-gcc-4.8.5-qemsqrc
@end example

@noindent
For Lmod modules, the module directory is one level below that and the
module names are a little different.

@example
module use /opt/spack/Modules/modules/linux-rhel7-x86_64/Core
module load gcc/7.4.0-dan4vbm
@end example

@noindent
For both TCL and Lmod modules, it's best to put the @code{module use}
command in your shell's startup scripts so that @code{module avail} and
@code{module load} will know where to find them.  After loading the
module, run @code{spack compiler find}.

@example
$ spack compiler find
==> Added 1 new compiler to /home/krentel/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml
    gcc@@7.4.0
@end example

@noindent
Finally, always check the new entry in @code{compilers.yaml} and add the
name of the module to the @code{modules:} field.

@example
- compiler:
    environment: @{@}
    extra_rpaths: []
    flags: @{@}
    modules:
    - gcc-7.4.0-gcc-4.8.5-qemsqrc
    operating_system: rhel7
    paths:
      cc:  /opt/spack/Modules/packages/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/gcc-7.4.0-qemsqrcwkk52f6neef4kg5wvoucsroif/bin/gcc
      cxx: /opt/spack/Modules/packages/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/gcc-7.4.0-qemsqrcwkk52f6neef4kg5wvoucsroif/bin/g++
      f77: /opt/spack/Modules/packages/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/gcc-7.4.0-qemsqrcwkk52f6neef4kg5wvoucsroif/bin/gfortran
      fc:  /opt/spack/Modules/packages/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/gcc-7.4.0-qemsqrcwkk52f6neef4kg5wvoucsroif/bin/gfortran
    spec: gcc@@7.4.0
    target: x86_64
@end example

@noindent
Note: as long as the spack packages and modules directories remain
intact and you don't remove the @code{compilers.yaml} entry, then this
compiler will always be available from within spack.  You can also use
this compiler outside of spack by using @code{module load}.  If you
want to make this your default compiler for all spack builds, then you
can specify this in @code{packages.yaml}.  For example,

@example
packages:
  all:
    compiler: [gcc@@7.4.0]
@end example

@noindent
Also, when using the compiler from within spack, it doesn't matter if
you have the module loaded or not.  Spack will erase your environment
and re-add the appropriate modules automatically.

@example
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#compiler-configuration}
@end example

@subsection Bootstrapping Environment Modules

If your system does not support modules, then you will have to add it.
If you have root access, the easiest solution is to install a system
package for modules.  If not, then use spack to install the
environment-modules package.  Source the bash or csh script in the
@code{init} directory to add the @code{module} function to your
environment.  For example,

@example
spack install environment-modules
cd /path/to/environment-modules-4.3.1-ism7cdy4xverxywj27jvjstqwk5oxe2v/init
(bash)  . ./bash
(csh)   source ./csh
@end example

@noindent
Again, add the setup command to your shell's startup scripts.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Spack Mirrors

A spack mirror allows you to download and save a source tar file in
advance.  This is useful if your system is behind a firewall, or if you
need to manually agree to a license, or if you just don't want to keep
downloading the same file over and over.

A mirror has a simple directory structure and is easy to set up.  Create
a top-level directory with subdirectories named after the spack packages
and copy the tar files into their package's subdirectory.  For example,

@example
my-mirror/
   boost/
      boost-1.66.0.tar.bz2      (from boost_1_66_0.tar.bz2)
      boost-1.70.0.tar.bz2
   dyninst/
      dyninst-10.1.0.tar.gz     (from git checkout)
   ibm-java/
      ibm-java-8.0.5.30.None    (from ibm-java-sdk-8.0-5.30-ppc64le-archive.bin)
   intel-xed/
      intel-xed-2019.03.01.tar.gz    (from git checkout)
      mbuild-2019.03.01.tar.gz       (resource from git checkout)
   jdk/
      jdk-1.8.0_202.tar.gz      (from jdk-8u202-linux-x64.tar.gz)
@end example

@noindent
Note: the names of the files in the spack mirror always follow the same,
specific format, regardless of the actual name of the tar file.  Version
is the spack name for the version (from @code{spack info}), and
extension is the same extension as the tar file (@code{tar.gz},
@code{tar.bz2}, etc) or else @code{None} for other types of files.

@example
<package-name> - <version> . <extension>
@end example

@noindent
For example, the boost 1.66.0 tar file is actually named
@code{boost_1_66_0.tar.bz2} but is stored in the mirror as
@code{boost-1.66.0.tar.bz2} and @code{jdk-8u202-linux-x64.tar.gz} is
renamed to @code{jdk-1.8.0_202.tar.gz}.

For packages that use a snapshot from a git repository (tag or commit
hash), clone the repository, checkout the desired version, make a tar
file and gzip the file.  (You should exclude the @code{.git}
subdirectory.)  But note that spack refuses to use a cached file for
the head of a branch because it is a moving target.

Finally, after creating the mirror directory, add it to spack with
@code{spack mirror add}.  For example,

@example
spack mirror add my-mirror file:///home/krentel/spack/my-mirror
spack mirror list
my-mirror    file:///home/krentel/spack/mirror
@end example

@noindent
Note: by default, spack stores downloaded files inside the spack
repository at @code{spack/var/spack/cache}.  This directory is a full
spack mirror, so instead of creating a separate directory tree, you
could just copy the files into the @code{cache} directory.  This is
useful when @code{spack fetch} has trouble downloading a file.  If you
can download the file manually, or copy it from another machine, then
just rename the file as above and copy it into the spack file cache.

For more information on mirrors, see:

@example
@uref{https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html}
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Common Problems

@subsection Unable to fetch tar file

Spack is somewhat fragile for how it downloads tar files and will
often fail for transitory network problems.  This is especially true
for packages with many dependencies.  For example:

@example
==> Installing m4
==> Searching for binary cache of m4
==> No binary for m4 found: installing from source
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: ftp.wayne.edu; Name or service not known
==> Fetching https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz
==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz failed.
==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for m4-1.4.18-vorbvkcjfac43b7vuswsvnm6xe7w7or5
@end example

@noindent
There are two workarounds.  First, assuming the problem is temporary,
simply wait 10 minutes or an hour and try again.  Second, you could
manually download the file(s) by some other means and copy them to
spack's cache directory @code{spack/var/spack/cache/<package>} or to a
spack mirror.

@subsection New releases break the build

Normally, HPCToolkit should build and work correctly with the latest
version for all of its dependencies.  But sometimes a new release will
change something and break the build.  This has happened a couple times
where a new release of Boost has broken the build for Dyninst.  Or,
maybe the latest version of gcc/g++ disallows some usage and breaks the
build.

The solution is to use @code{packages.yaml} to specify an earlier
version until the rest of the code adapts to the change.

@subsection Failure to load modules

Spack is quite aggressive about compiling with a clean environment and
will unload modules unless they are specifically required by some config
file (@code{compilers.yaml} or @code{packages.yaml}).  This can result
in a situation where you think some compiler or build tool is available
from your environment but spack removes it during the build.

In this example, I am using modules for @code{GCC/6.4.0} and
@code{CMake/3.8.2}.  Spack finds the gcc 6.4.0 compiler and I added
@code{cmake@@3.8.2} to @code{packages.yaml}.  But I failed to add the
@code{modules:} field for gcc 6.4.0 in @code{compilers.yaml}.  As a
result, the build fails with:

@example
cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found (required by cmake)
cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found (required by cmake)
cmake: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.9' not found (required by cmake)
==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 1:
@end example

@noindent
The problem is that cmake 3.8.2 was built with g++ 6.4.0, but spack is
running cmake without the GCC/6.4.0 libraries and so the build fails as
above.  One way to confirm this is to rerun @code{spack install --dirty}
which then succeeds.  The @code{--dirty} option tells spack not to
unload your modules.  Whenever the build fails with a mismatched library
as above and especially when @code{--dirty} fixes the problem, this is a
clear sign that spack is missing a module during the build.

Although @code{--dirty} may make the build succeed, there should be no
case where this is necessary.  The correct solution is to fill in the
@code{modules:} field in @code{compilers.yaml} or some other config
file.  See the section on Compilers above.
