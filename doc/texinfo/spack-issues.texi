@section Introduction

Spack is a moving target and receives multiple commits per day.
Normally, HPCToolkit will build and run successfully with the latest
version of all of its prerequisite packages, but sometimes not.  This
page covers the current known issues where HPCToolkit fails to build
with the latest version of spack.  The main build directions are at:

@ifhtml
@uref{software-instructions.html}
@end ifhtml
@ifinfo
README.Install
@end ifinfo

@noindent
Report problems to @code{hpctoolkit-forum at rice dot edu}.  But before
reporting a problem, first try the versions recommended in the
@code{packages.yaml} file in the @code{spack} subdirectory of the
hpctoolkit repository.  And always check the latest version of this file
on the hpctoolkit web site.

@example
@uref{http://hpctoolkit.org/spack-issues.html}

@section Current Issues

@subsection (2020-09-05) Configure warns about -fPIC.

As of commit
@uref{https://github.com/HPCToolkit/hpctoolkit/pull/317, b2d3d067ecad}
on 2020-09-05, the master branch now wants libunwind and xz (lzma) to
be built with variant @code{+pic}.  This is used to workaround a
deadlock with hpcrun, openmpi 4.x and UCX.  If not, then you'll see
this warning at the bottom of configure.

@example
WARNING: The following prereqs are missing an archive (.a) compiled with -fPIC.
WARNING:    libunwind lzma
WARNING: 
WARNING: hpcrun is unable to properly hide these libraries from the
WARNING: application and this may cause deadlock or segfault.
WARNING: Recompile the above libraries with -fPIC (+pic in spack).
@end example

@noindent
For now, this is only a warning.  Everything will work as before, you
just won't get the benefit of the work around.  But going forward, you
should build libunwind and xz with variant @code{+pic}.  For example,
in @code{packages.yaml}.

@example
libunwind:
  version:  [1.4.0]
  variants: +xz +pic
xz:
  version:  [5.2.5]
  variants: +pic
@end example

@section Recently Resolved Issues

@subsection (2020-06-29) Cray front-end compilers

@code{Spack compiler find} was previously broken for detecting the
front-end compilers on Cray that HPCToolkit uses.

@noindent
@b{Fixed:} This is now fixed in commit
@uref{https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/17267, 789d060ff61b}
on 2020-06-29.

@noindent
@b{Note:} Remember, you still need to fill in the @code{modules:}
field with the following four modules.  For example, this is an entry
for the @code{gcc/8.3.0} module on theta at ANL.  Note that the
front-end operating_system is something like @code{sles15} (not
@code{cnl6}), and the front-end target is @code{x86_64} (not
@code{mic_knl}).  Your versions may differ.

@example
- compiler:
    environment: @{@}
    flags: @{@}
    modules:
    - PrgEnv-gnu/6.0.7
    - gcc/8.3.0
    - craype/2.6.5
    - cray-mpich/7.7.14
    operating_system: sles15
    paths:
      cc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gcc
      cxx: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/g++
      f77: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
      fc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
    spec: gcc@@8.3.0
    target: x86_64
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section General Problems

These are general problems that arise from time to time.

@subsection Unable to fetch

Sometimes spack fails to download the source file(s) for some package
and dies with a message similar to this.

@example
==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz failed.
==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for m4-1.4.18-vorbvkcjfac43b7vuswsvnm6xe7w7or5
@end example

@noindent
This problem is usually temporary and the solution is to either wait a
few minutes or an hour and try again, or else download the file manually
and put it into a spack mirror.

@subsection Connection timeout

Another way fetch can fail is with a connection timeout.  Some sites,
especially sourceforge are often slow to connect.  If this happens, then
increase the connection timeout in @code{config.yaml} to 30 or 60
seconds (default is 10 seconds).

@subsection New version breaks the build

Sometimes the latest version of some package breaks the build.  This has
happened a couple of times where a new version of Boost has broken the
build for Dyninst.  The solution is to revert the package to an earlier
version until the rest of the code catches up.

@subsection Spack core breaks the build

Sometimes but rarely, something in the spack core will change or break
the code in some @code{package.py} file.  The solution is to look
through the spack git log and revert the repository to a recent commit
before the breakage.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Long Term Issues

@subsection Boost 1.68.0

Avoid boost version 1.68.0, it breaks the build for hpctoolkit.  Version
1.70.0 works with the latest version of dyninst (10.1.0), or else 1.66.0
is good and works with all versions of dyninst.

@subsection Elfutils 0.176

Elfutils 0.176 requires glibc 2.16 or later (for @code{aligned_alloc})
and won't work with an older glibc, including RedHat or CentOS 6.x and
Blue Gene.  On systems with an old glibc, use version 0.175.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsection IBM-Java fails to fetch (powerpc)

IBM is fairly aggressive about taking down old versions, so you may find
that fetching ibm-java fails while trying to install hpcviewer (powerpc
only).

@example
==> Installing ibm-java
==> No binary for ibm-java found: installing from source
==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed
@end example

@noindent
If this happens, first compare @code{spack info ibm-java} with what
versions are available at IBM's download site.  If there is another
8.0.x.y version that spack understands that is still available for
download, then use that.

@example
@uref{http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/systems/cloud/runtimes/java}
@end example

@noindent
If not, then manually download the latest 8.0.x.y version, compute a
@code{sha256sum} checksum for the file and then edit the
@code{ibm-java/package.py} file to add this version.  And then report
the problem to the spack maintainer.

@bye
