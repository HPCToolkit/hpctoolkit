@section Introduction

Spack is a moving target and receives multiple commits per day.
Normally, HPCToolkit will build and run successfully with the latest
version of all of its prerequisite packages, but sometimes not.  This
page covers the current known issues where HPCToolkit fails to build
with the latest version of spack.  The main build directions are at:

@ifhtml
@uref{software-instructions.html}
@end ifhtml
@ifinfo
README.Install
@end ifinfo

@noindent
Report problems to @code{hpctoolkit-forum at rice dot edu}.  But before
reporting a problem, first try the versions recommended in the
@code{packages.yaml} file in the @code{spack} subdirectory of the
hpctoolkit repository.  And always check the latest version of this file
on the hpctoolkit web site.

@example
@uref{http://hpctoolkit.org/spack-issues.html}

@section Current Issues

@subsection (2019-08-28) Cray front-end compilers

@code{Spack compiler find} is currently broken for detecting the
front-end compilers on Cray that HPCToolkit uses.  Normally, you would
load a module for gcc and run @code{spack compiler find} and spack would
add that compiler to @code{compilers.yaml}, but this currently does not
work.

@b{Workaround:} If you have a working @code{compiler:} entry for a
front-end GNU compiler on Cray, then that will continue to work.  If
not, then you will have to add one manually.  For example, this is an
entry for the @code{gcc/8.3.0} module on theta at ANL.  Note that the
front-end operating_system is something like @code{sles12} (not
@code{cnl6}), and the front-end target is @code{x86_64} (not
@code{mic_knl}).  Your versions may differ.

@example
- compiler:
    environment: @{@}
    flags: @{@}
    modules:
    - PrgEnv-gnu/6.0.5
    - gcc/8.3.0
    - craype/2.6.1
    - cray-mpich/7.7.10
    operating_system: sles12
    paths:
      cc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gcc
      cxx: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/g++
      f77: /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
      fc:  /opt/gcc/8.3.0/bin/gfortran
    spec: gcc@@8.3.0
    target: x86_64
@end example

@noindent
@b{Note:} Be sure to fill in the @code{modules:} field with all four
modules.

@section Recently Resolved Issues

@subsection (2020-03-27) Intel-TBB checksums don't match

Intel recently moved the TBB project on GitHub to a new repository,
@code{oneAPI-SRC/oneTBB}.  When downloading the intel-tbb tar file,
github makes the tar file on the fly, and this includes the new
top-level directory name (oneTBB).  The contents of the tar file are the
same, but the new directory name is enough to invalidate the spack
checksum.

@noindent
@b{Fixed:} The new checksums were added to spack in commit
@uref{https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/15675, 16f104aafe2b}
on 2020-03-27.  So, if you update your spack repository after this
commit, then the checksums will match.

@noindent
@b{Workaround:} If you have an older spack repository, then you will
need to disable verifying checksums.

@example
spack install --no-checksum intel-tbb
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section General Problems

These are general problems that arise from time to time.

@subsection Unable to fetch

Sometimes spack fails to download the source file(s) for some package
and dies with a message similar to this.

@example
==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz failed.
==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for m4-1.4.18-vorbvkcjfac43b7vuswsvnm6xe7w7or5
@end example

@noindent
This problem is usually temporary and the solution is to either wait a
few minutes or an hour and try again, or else download the file manually
and put it into a spack mirror.

@subsection Connection timeout

Another way fetch can fail is with a connection timeout.  Some sites,
especially sourceforge are often slow to connect.  If this happens, then
increase the connection timeout in @code{config.yaml} to 30 or 60
seconds (default is 10 seconds).

@subsection New version breaks the build

Sometimes the latest version of some package breaks the build.  This has
happened a couple of times where a new version of Boost has broken the
build for Dyninst.  The solution is to revert the package to an earlier
version until the rest of the code catches up.

@subsection Spack core breaks the build

Sometimes but rarely, something in the spack core will change or break
the code in some @code{package.py} file.  The solution is to look
through the spack git log and revert the repository to a recent commit
before the breakage.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Long Term Issues

@subsection Boost 1.68.0

Avoid boost version 1.68.0, it breaks the build for hpctoolkit.  Version
1.70.0 works with the latest version of dyninst (10.1.0), or else 1.66.0
is good and works with all versions of dyninst.

@subsection Elfutils 0.176

Elfutils 0.176 requires glibc 2.16 or later (for @code{aligned_alloc})
and won't work with an older glibc, including RedHat or CentOS 6.x and
Blue Gene.  On systems with an old glibc, use version 0.175.
