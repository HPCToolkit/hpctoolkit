\begin{Name}{1}{hpcprof-mpi}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{hpcprof-mpi:\\ Analysis and Attribution of Call Path Performance Measurements}

\Prog{hpcprof-mpi} \emph{scalably} analyzes call path profile performance measurements (in parallel) and attributes them to static source code structure.
See \HTMLhref{hpctoolkit.html}{\Cmd{hpctoolkit}{1}} for an overview of \textbf{HPCToolkit}.

\end{Name}

\section{Synopsis}

\Prog{hpcprof-mpi} \oOpt{options} \Arg{measurement-group}...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Description}

\Prog{hpcprof-mpi} analyzes call path profile performance measurements,
attributes them to static source code structure,
and generates an experiment database for use with \HTMLhref{hpcviewer.html}{\Cmd{hpcviewer}{1}}.
\Prog{hpcprof-mpi} is especially designed for analyzing and attributing measurements
from large-scale executions.

\Prog{hpcprof-mpi} expects a list of \emph{measurement groups},
each of which is either a call path profile directory or an individual profile file.
For best results, one other option should be given:
\textbf{-I} to specify search directories for source code files.
If {\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}} was run on the measurements directory, no \textbf{-S} to provide structure files is needed.
is needed.
If no search directory arguments are given,
\Prog{hpcprof-mpi} will find only those source files that are specified via
either an absolute path still preseent in the file system
or a relative path w.r.t. the current working directory.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Arguments}

\begin{Description}
\item[\Arg{measurement-group}...] A sequence of file system paths,
each speciufying a call path profile directory or an individual profile file.
\end{Description}

Default values for an option's optional arguments are shown in \{\}.

\subsection{Options: Informational}

\begin{Description}

\item[\OptoArg{-v}{n}, \OptoArg{--verbose}{n}]
Print progress messages to stderr at verbosity level \Arg{n}.  \{1\}

\item[\Opt{-V}, \Opt{--version}]
Print version information.

\item[\Opt{-h}, \Opt{--help}]
Print help.

\item[\OptoArg{--debug}{n}]
Print debugging messages at level \Arg{n}. \{1\}

\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: Source Code and Static Structure}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptArg{--name}{name}, \OptArg{--title}{name}]
Set the database's name (title) to \Arg{name}.

\item[\OptArg{-I}{dir}, \OptArg{--include}{dir}]
Use \Arg{dir} as a search directory to find source files.
For a recursive search, append a '+' after the last slash, e.g., \texttt{/mypath/+}.
This option may be given multiple times.
\medskip
If a file appears in more than one search directory,
the ambiguity is resolved in favor of the search directory which occurred first on the command line.

\item[\OptArg{-S}{file}, \OptArg{--structure}{file}]
Use the structure file \Arg{file} produced by \HTMLhref{hpcstruct.html}{\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}}
This option may be given multiple times,
e.g. to provide structure for shared libraries in addition to the application executable.
It is normally not needed if {\Cmd{hpcstruct}{1}} was run on the measurements directory.

\item[\OptArg{-R}{'old-path=new-path'}, \OptArg{--replace-path}{'old-path=new-path'}]
Replace every instance of \Arg{old-path} by \Arg{new-path}
in all paths for which \Arg{old-path} is a prefix of a path to a binary measured by HPCToolkit
or a source file used to produce a binary measured by HPCToolkit.
Use '\Bs'\ to escape instances of '=' within a path.
This option may be given multiple times.
\medskip
Use this option when a profile or binary contains references to files no
longer present at their original path.
For instance, a library may have been compiled by a system administrator and
distributed with line map information containing file paths that point to a
build directory that no longer exists.
If you can locate a copy of the source code for the library, you can unpack
it anywhere and provide a -R option that maps the prefix of the build
directory to the prefix of the directory where you unpacked a copy of the library sources.

\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: Metrics}

\begin{Description}

\item[\OptArg{-M}{metric}, \OptArg{--metric}{metric}]
Compute the specified metrics, where \Arg{metric} is one of the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[sum] Sum over threads/processes
  \item[stats] Sum, Mean, StdDev (standard deviation), CoefVar (coefficient of variation),
  Min, Max over threads/processes
  \item[thread] per-thread/process metrics
  \end{itemize}
Note that \Cmd{hpcprof-mpi}{1} cannot compute \Prog{thread}.

The default metric is \Prog{sum}.
This option may be given multiple times.

\item[\Opt{--force-metric}]
Show all thread-level metrics regardless of their number.

\item[\OptArg{--normalize}{all | none}]
If this option is \Prog{all}, normalize call paths in profiles to hide implementation details;
if \Prog{none}, do not normalize.
If not given, the default is \Prog{all}..

\end{Description}

\subsection{Options: Output}

\begin{Description}

\item[\OptArg{-o}{db-path}, \OptArg{--db}{db-path}, \OptArg{--output}{db-path}]
Write the computed experiment database to \Arg{db-path}.
The default path is \File{./hpctoolkit-$<$application$>$-database}.

\item[\OptArg{--metric-db}{yes | no}]
If \Prog{yes}, generate a thread-level metric value database for \Prog{hpcviewer} scatter plots.
The default is \Prog{yes}.

\item[\Opt{--remove-redundancy}]
Eliminate procedure name redundancy in output file \File{experiment.xml}.

\item[\Opt{--struct-id}]
Add 'str=nnn' field to profile data with the hpcstruct node id.
The default is \Prog{no}.
