	Abstract = {HPCTOOLKIT is an integrated suite of tools that supports measurement, analysis, attribution, and presentation of application performance for both sequential and parallel programs. HPCTOOLKIT can pinpoint and quantify scalability bottlenecks in fully optimized parallel programs with a measurement overhead of only a few percent. Recently, new capabilities were added to HPCTOOLKIT for collecting call path profiles for fully optimized codes without any compiler support, pinpointing and quantifying bottlenecks in multithreaded programs, exploring performance information and source code using a new user interface, and displaying hierarchical space-time diagrams based on traces of asynchronous call path samples. This paper provides an overview of HPCTOOLKIT and illustrates its utility for performance analysis of parallel applications.},

	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {Tuning the performance of applications requires understanding the interactions between code and target architecture. This paper describes a performance modeling approach that not only makes accurate predictions about the behavior of an application on a target architecture for different inputs, but also provides guidance for tuning by high-lighting the factors that limit performance in each section of a program. We introduce two new performance metrics that estimate the maximum gain expected from tuning different parts of an application, or from increasing the number of machine resources. We show how this metric helped identify a bottleneck in the ASCI SweepSD benchmark where the lack of instruction-level parallelism limited performance. Transforming one frequently executed loop to ameliorate this bottleneck improved performance by 16% on an Itanium2 system.},

As part of activities associated with the SciDAC Center for Scalable Application Development Software (CScADS) and the Performance Engineering Research Institute (PERI), Rice University is building software tools for performance analysis of scientific applications on the leadership-class platforms. In this poster abstract, we briefly describe the HPCToolkit performance tools and how they can be used to pinpoint bottlenecks in SPMD and multi-threaded parallel codes. We demonstrate HPCToolkit's utility by applying it to two SciDAC applications: the S3D code for simulation of turbulent combustion and the MFDn code for ab initio calculations of microscopic structure of nuclei.},

HPCToolkit: Top-down analysis of node performance Nathan Tallent (in conjunction with John Mellor-Crummey, Robert Fowler, Gabriel Marin,and Nathan Froyd of the Rice Parallel Compilers Group)

It is increasingly difficult for complex scientific programs to attain a significant fraction of peak performance on systems that are based on microprocessors with substantial instruction-level parallelism and deep memory hierarchies. Despite this trend, performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers.

To a large extent, existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use. To address these issues, we developed HPCToolkit - a toolkit for 1) collecting profile data from unmodified optimized binaries, 2) recovering a binary's static structure (esp. loop nests), 3) correlating performance metrics with program structure and synthesizing derived metrics that cannot be directly measured, and 4) generating a high-level view of performance information that is correlated with program source code and presented in a graphical user interface that enables intuitive, interactive, top-down exploration of results. We present an overview of HPCToolkit and argue that it addresses many of the issues that have limited the usability and the utility of most existing tools.

All tools in HPCToolkit are open source and multi-platform. They are currently in use on LANL's HP/Compaq Alphaserver+Quadrics cluster (Alpha+Tru64), SGI Origin (MIPS+Irix), Rice's HP Itanium2+Myrinet cluster (Itanium+Linux), along with Pentium-based desktops running Linux.

Abstract:
The challenge of developing scalable parallel applications is only partially aided by existing languages and compilers. As a result, manual performance tuning is often necessary to identify and resolve poor parallel efficiency. To help resolve performance problems, I have developed novel techniques for pinpointing performance problems in multithreaded and petascale programs. These techniques are based on attributing very precise (instruction-level) measurements to their full static and dynamic context --- all for a run time overhead of less than 5%. First, I present binary analysis for performance measurement and attribution of fully-optimized programs. Second, I describe techniques for measuring and analyzing the performance of multithreaded executions. Third, I show how to diagnose scalability bottlenecks in petascale applications. This work is implemented in Rice University's HPCToolkit performance tools.

ABSTRACT:
Cutting-edge science and engineering applications require petascale computing. Petascale computing platforms are characterized by both extreme parallelism (systems of hundreds of thousands to millions of cores) and hybrid parallelism (nodes with multicore chips). Consequently, to effectively use petascale resources, applications must exploit concurrency at both the node and system level --- a difficult problem. The challenge of developing scalable petascale applications is only partially aided by existing languages and compilers. As a result, manual performance tuning is often necessary to identify and resolve poor parallel and serial efficiency. We claim that it is possible to achieve unique, accurate, and actionable insight into the performance of fully optimized parallel programs by measuring them with asynchronous-sampling-based call path profiles; attributing the resulting binary-level measurements to source code structure; analyzing measurements on-the-fly and post-mortem to highlight performance inefficiencies; and presenting the resulting context-sensitive metrics in three complementary views. To support this claim, we have developed several techniques for identifying performance problems in fully optimized serial, multithreaded and petascale programs. First, we describe how to attribute very precise (instruction-level) measurements to source-level static and dynamic contexts in fully optimized applications --- all for an average run-time overhead of a few percent. We then generalize this work with the development of logical call path profiling and apply it to work-stealing-based applications. Second, we describe techniques for pinpointing and quantifying parallel inefficiencies such as parallel idleness, parallel overhead and lock contention in multithreaded executions. Third, we show how to diagnose scalability bottlenecks in petascale applications by scaling our our measurement, analysis and presentation tools to support large-scale executions. This work forms the basis of Rice University's HPCToolkit performance tools.
