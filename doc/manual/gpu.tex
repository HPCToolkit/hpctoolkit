HPCToolkit can measure both the CPU and GPU performance of GPU-accelerated applications. It can measure CPU performance using asynchronous sampling triggered by Linux timers or hardware counter events as described in 
Section~\ref{sample-sources} and it can monitor GPU performance using tool support libraries provided by GPU vendors.

The foundation of HPCToolkit's support for measuring the performance of GPU-accelerated applications is a vendor-independent monitoring substrate. A thin software layer connects NVIDIA's CUPTI (CUDA Performance Tools Interface)~\cite{cupti} and AMD's ROC-tracer (ROCm Tracer Callback/Activity Library)~\cite{roctracer} monitoring libraries to this substrate. HPCToolkit reports GPU performance metrics in a vendor-neutral way. For instance, rather than focusing on NVIDIA warps or AMD wavefronts, HPCToolkit presents both as fine-grain, thread-level parallelism.

In the following sections, we describe how to use HPCToolkit to measure GPU metrics for GPU-accelerated applications. We begin with a discussion of NVIDIA GPUs since HPCToolkit's support for them is more complete than for others.

\section{NVIDIA GPUs}

HPCToolkit supports two levels of performance monitoring for NVIDIA GPUs: coarse-grain profiling and tracing of GPU activities at the operation level (e.g., kernel launches, data allocations, memory copies, ...) , and fine-grain profiling of GPU computations using PC sampling, which measures GPU computations at a granularity of individual machine instructions. Section~\ref{nvidia-pc-sampling} describes fine-grain GPU performance measurement using PC sampling and the metrics it measures or computes. 

While performing coarse-grain GPU monitoring of kernel executions, memory copies, and other GPU activities, HPCToolkit will collect a trace of activity for each GPU stream if tracing is enabled. Table~\ref{nvidia-monitoring-options} shows the possible command-line arguments to \hpcrun{} that will enable different levels of monitoring  for NVIDIA GPUs. When fine-grain monitoring using PC sampling is enabled, coarse-grain profiling is also performed, so tracing is available in this mode as well. However, since PC sampling dilates the CPU overhead of GPU-accelerated codes, tracing is not recommended when PC sampling is enabled.

Coarse-grain profiling attributes to each calling context the total time of all GPU operations initiated in that context. Table~\ref
{table:gtimes} shows the classes of GPU operations for which timings are collected. In addition, HPCToolkit records metrics for  operations performed including memory allocation and deallocation (Table~\ref{table:gmem}), memory set (Table~\ref{table:gmset}), explicit memory copies (Table~\ref{table:gxcopy}), and synchronization (Table~\ref{table:gsync}). In addition, HPCToolkit reports GPU kernel characteristics, including including register usage,  thread count per block, and theoretical occupancy as shown in Table~\ref{table:gker}. NVIDIA defines theoretical occupancy as the ratio of the active threads in a streaming multiprocessor to the maximum active threads supported by the hardware in one streaming multiprocessor.

At present, using NVIDIA's CUPTI library adds substantial measurement overhead.  Unlike CPU monitoring based on asynchronous sampling, GPU performance monitoring uses vendor-provided callback interfaces to intercept the initiation of each GPU operation. Accordingly,  the overhead of GPU performance monitoring depends upon how frequently GPU operations are initiated. 
In our experience to date, profiling (and if requested, tracing) on NVIDIA GPUs using NVIDIA's CUPTI interface roughly doubles the execution time of a GPU-accelerated application. In our experience, we have seen NVIDIA's PC sampling dilate the execution time of a GPU-accelerated program by $30\times$ using CUDA 10 or earlier.  Our early experience with CUDA 11 indicates that overhead using PC sampling is much lower and less than $5\times$. The overhead of GPU monitoring is principally on the host side. As measured by CUPTI, the time spent in GPU operations or PC samples is expected to be relatively accurate. However, since execution as a whole is slowed while measuring GPU performance, when evaluating GPU activity reported by HPCToolkit, one must be careful.

For instance, if a GPU-accelerated program runs in 1000 seconds without HPCToolkit monitoring GPU activity but slows to 2000 seconds when GPU profiling and tracing is enabled, then if GPU profiles and traces show that the GPU is active for 25\% of the execution time, one should  re-scale the accurate measurements of GPU activity by considering the $2\times$ dilation when monitoring GPU activity. Without monitoring, one would expect the same level of GPU activity, but the host time would be twice as fast. Thus, without monitoring, the ratio of GPU activity to host activity would be roughly double.
 

\subsection{PC Sampling on NVIDIA GPUs}
\label{nvidia-pc-sampling} 

NVIDIA's GPUs have supported PC sampling since Maxwell~\cite{cuptipcsampling}.
Instruction samples are collected separately on each active streaming
multiprocessor (SM) and merged in a buffer returned by NVIDIA's CUPTI. 
In each sampling period, one warp scheduler of each active SM 
samples the next instruction from one of its active warps. Sampling rotates through
an SM's warp schedulers in a round robin fashion.
When an instruction is sampled, its stall reason (if any) is
recorded. If all warps on a scheduler are stalled when a sample is
taken, the sample is marked as a latency sample, meaning no instruction will be issued by the warp scheduler in the next cycle.
Figure~\ref{fig:pc sampling} shows a PC sampling example on an SM with four schedulers. Among the six collected samples, four are latency samples, so the estimated stall ratio is $4/6$. 

Figure~\ref{table:pc-stall} shows the stall metrics recorded by HPCToolkit using CUPTI's PC sampling. Figure~\ref{table:gsamp} shows PC sampling summary statistics recorded by HPCToolkit. Of particular note is the metric \verb|GSAMP:UTIL|. HPCToolkit computes approximate GPU utilization using information gathered using PC sampling. Given the average clock frequency and the sampling rate, if all SMs are active, then HPCToolkit knows how many instruction samples would be expected ({\tt GSAMP:EXP}) if the GPU was fully active for the interval when it was in use. HPCToolkit approximates the percentage of GPU utilization by comparing the measured samples with the expected samples using the following formula: $100 * {\tt (GSAMP:TOT)/ (GSAMP:EXP)}$.

For CUDA 10, measurement using PC sampling with CUPTI serializes the execution of GPU kernels. Thus, measurement of GPU kernels using PC sampling will distort the execution of a GPU-accelerated application by blocking concurrent execution of GPU kernels. For applications that rely on concurrent kernel execution to keep the GPU busy, this will significantly distort execution and PC sampling measurements will only reflect the GPU activity of kernels running in isolation.




\subsection{Attributing Measurements to Source Code for NVIDIA GPUs}

NVIDIA's {\tt nvcc} compiler doesn't record information about how GPU machine code maps to CUDA source without proper compiler arguments. Using the {\tt -G} compiler option to {\tt nvcc}, one may generate NVIDIA CUBINs with full DWARF information that includes not only line maps, which map each machine instruction back to a program source line, but also detailed information about inlined code. However, the price of turning on {\tt -G} is that optimization by {\tt nvcc} will be disabled. For that reason, the performance of code compiled {\tt -G} is vastly slower. While a developer of a template-based programming model may find this option useful to see how a program employs templates to instantiate GPU code, measurements of code compiled with {\tt -G} should be viewed with skeptical eye.

One can use {\tt nvcc}'s {\tt -lineinfo } option to instruct {\tt nvcc} to record line map information during compilation.\footnote{Line maps relate each machine instruction back to the program source line from where it came.} The {\tt -lineinfo} option can be used in conjunction with {\tt nvcc} optimization. Using {\tt -lineinfo}, one can measure and interpret the performance of optimized code. However, line map information is a poor substitute for full DWARF information. When {\tt nvcc} inlines code during optimization, the resulting line map information simply shows that source lines that were compiled into a GPU function. A developer examining performance measurements for a function must reason on their own about how any source lines from outside the function got there as the result of inlining and/or macro expansion.

When HPCToolkit uses NVIDIA's CUPTI to monitor a GPU-accelerated application, 
CUPTI notifies HPCToolkit every time it loads a CUDA binary, known as a CUBIN, into a GPU.
At runtime, HPCToolkit computes a cryptographic hash of a CUBIN's contents and records the CUBIN into the execution's measurement directory. 
For instance, if a GPU-accelerated application loaded CUBIN into a GPU, NVIDIA's CUPTI informed HPCToolkit that the CUBIN was being loaded, and HPCToolkit computed its cryptographic hash as {\tt 972349aed8}, then HPCToolkit would record {\tt 972349aed8.cubin} inside a {\tt cubins} subdirectory of an HPCToolkit measurement directory. 

To  attribute GPU performance measurements back to source, HPCToolkit's \hpcstruct{} supports analysis of NVIDIA CUBIN binaries. Since many CUBIN binaries may be loaded  by a GPU-accelerated application during execution,  an application's measurements directory may contain a {\tt cubins} subdirectory populated with many CUBINs. In this case, it would be inconvenient to require a developer to apply \hpcstruct{} manually to analyze each CUBIN. To simplify the analysis of an execution's CUBINs, a developer may apply HPCToolkit's \hpcstruct{} directly to a measurement directory to analyze all of the CUBINs it contains. Namely, for a measurements directory {\tt hpctoolkit-laghos-measurements} collected during an execution of the GPU-accelerated laghos mini-app~\cite{laghos}, one can analyze all of the CUBINs collected during execution by using the following command:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
hpcstruct hpctoolkit-laghos-measurements
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


Since there may be many CUBINs inside an HPCToolkit measurements directory for a GPU-accelerated application, it is useful to accelerate the analysis of an execution's CUBINs by employing parallelism. One can analyze large or many CUBINs in an HPCToolkit measurements directory using multiple threads by specifying \hpcstruct's '\verb|-j|~$n$' option. For instance, one can use 16 threads to analyze the CUBINs in the {\tt hpctoolkit-laghos-measurements} directory with the following command:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
hpcstruct -j 16 hpctoolkit-laghos-measurements
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

With the default settings of \hpcstruct{}, if the '\verb|-j|~$n$' argument is specified, each CUBIN larger than 100MB will be analyzed using $n$ threads. Smaller CUBINs will be analyzed in parallel by using a pool of $n$ threads to analyze $n$ small CUBINs concurrently. 

By default, when applied to a measurements directory, \hpcstruct{} performs only lightweight analysis of the GPU functions in each CUBIN. When a measurements directory contains fine-grain measurements collected using PC sampling, it is useful to perform a more detailed analysis to recover information about the loops and call sites of GPU functions in an NVIDIA CUBIN. Unfortunately, NVIDIA has refused to provide an API that would enable HPCToolkit to perform instruction-level analysis of CUBINs directly. Instead, HPCToolkit must invoke NVIDIA's {\tt nvdisasm} command line utility to compute control flow graphs for functions in a CUBIN. The version of {\tt nvdisasm} in CUDA 10 is slow and fails to compute control flow graphs for some GPU functions. In such cases, \hpcstruct{} reverts to lightweight analysis of GPU functions that considers only line map information. Because analysis of CUBINs using {\tt nvdisasm} is slow, it is not performed by default. To enable detailed analysis of GPU functions, use the {\tt --gpucfg yes} option to \hpcstruct{}, as shown below:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
hpcstruct -j 16 --gpucfg yes hpctoolkit-laghos-measurements
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


\subsection{GPU Calling Context Tree Reconstruction}
\label{nvidia-cct}



The CUPTI API returns flat PC samples without any information about GPU call stacks.
With complex code generated from template-based GPU programming models, calling contexts on GPUs are essential for developers to understand the code and its performance. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's GPU-accelerated Quicksilver proxy app~\cite{quicksilver} illustrates this problem. Figure~\ref{qs-no-cct} shows a \hpcviewer{} screenshot of Quicksilver without approximate reconstruction the GPU calling context tree. The figure shows a top-down view of heterogeneous calling contexts that span both the CPU and GPU. In the middle of the figure is a placeholder \verb|<gpu kernel>| that is inserted by HPCToolkit. Above the placeholder is a CPU calling context where a GPU kernel was invoked. Below the \verb|<gpu kernel>| placeholder, \hpcviewer{} shows a dozen of the GPU functions that were executed on behalf of the GPU kernel \verb|CycleTrackingKernel|. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{qs-no-cct.pdf}
\caption{A screenshot of \hpcviewer{} for the GPU-accelerated Quicksilver proxy app without GPU CCT reconstruction.}
\label{qs-no-cct}
\end{figure}


Currently, no API is available for efficiently unwinding call stacks on NVIDIA's GPUs.
To address this issue, we designed a method to reconstruct approximate GPU calling contexts using post-mortem analysis. This analysis is only performed when (1) an execution has been monitored using PC sampling, and (2) an execution's CUBINs have analyzed in detail using \hpcstruct{} with the {\tt --gpucfg yes} option.

To reconstruct approximate calling context trees for GPU computations, HPCToolkit uses information about call sites identified by \hpcstruct{} in conjunction with PC samples measured for each {\tt call} instruction in GPU binaries. 

Without the ability to measure each function invocation in detail, HPCToolkit assumes that each invocation of a particular GPU function incurs the same costs. The costs of each GPU function are apportioned among its caller or callers using the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
If a GPU function G can only be invoked from a single call site, all of the measured cost of G will be attributed to its call site. 
\item
If a GPU function G can be called from multiple call sites and PC samples have been collected for one or more of the call instructions for G, the costs for G are proportionally divided among G's call sites according to the distribution of PC samples for calls that invoke G.  For instance, consider the case where there are three call sites where G may be invoked, 5 samples are recorded for the first call instruction, 10 samples are recorded for the second call instruction, and no samples are recorded for the third call. In this case, HPCToolkit divides the costs for G  among the first two call sites, attributing $5/15$ of G's costs  to the first call site and $10/15$ of G's costs to the second call site. 
\item
If no call instructions for a GPU function G have been sampled, the costs of G are apportioned evenly among each of G's call sites.
\end{itemize}

IHPCToolkit's {\tt hpcprof} analyzes the static call graph associated with each GPU kernel invocation. If the static call graph for the GPU kernel contains cycles, which arise from recursive or mutually-recursive calls,  \hpcprof{} replaces each cycle with a strongly connected component (SCC). In this case, \hpcprof{} unlink's call graph edges between vertices within the SCC and adds an SCC vertex to enclose the set of vertices in each SCC. The rest of \hpcprof{}'s analysis 
treats an SCC vertex as a normal ``function'' in the call graph.

Figure~\ref{fig:gpu calling context tree} illustrates the reconstruction of an approximate calling context tree for a GPU computation given the static call graph (computed by \hpcstruct{} from a CUBIN's machine instructions) and PC sample counts for some or all GPU instructions in the CUBIN. Figure~\ref{qs-cct} shows an \hpcviewer{} screenshot for the GPU-accelerated Quicksilver proxy app following reconstruction of GPU calling contexts using the algorithm described in this section. Notice that after the reconstruction, one can see that \verb|CycleTrackingKernel| calls \verb|CycleTrackingGuts|, which calls \verb|CollisionEvent|, which eventually calls  \verb|macroscopicCrossSection| and \verb|NuclearData::getNumberOfReactions|. The the rich  approximate GPU calling context tree reconstructed by \hpcprof{} also shows loop nests and inlined code.\footnote{The control flow graph used to produce this reconstruction for Quicksilver was computed with a pre-release version of {\tt nvdisasm}. You will not be able to reproduce these results with CUDA 10's {\tt nvdisasm} because the released version of {\tt nvdisasm} fails to analyze some of the key functions in Quicksilver.}



\section{AMD GPUs}

HPCToolkit provides {\em alpha}-level support for coarse-grain profiling of GPU-accelerated  applications that offload computation onto AMD GPUs using  AMD's HIP programming model. Table~\ref{amd-options} shows arguments to \hpcrun{} to monitor the performance of GPU operations on AMD GPUs. With this coarse-grain profiling support, HPCToolkit can collect GPU operation timings (Table~\ref
{table:gtimes}) and a subset of standard metrics for GPU operations such as memory allocation and deallocation (Table~\ref{table:gmem}), memory set (Table~\ref{table:gmset}), explicit memory copies (Table~\ref{table:gxcopy}), and synchronization (Table~\ref{table:gsync}). 

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3.5in}|}\hline
Argument to \hpcrun{} & What is monitored\\\hline\hline
{\tt -e gpu=amd} & profiling of AMD GPU operations\\\hline
{\tt -e gpu=amd -t} & profiling and tracing of AMD GPU operations\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Monitoring performance on AMD GPUs.}
\label{amd-options}
\end{table}

At present, HPCToolkit's support for monitoring on AMD GPUs is incomplete. The HPCToolkit team is awaiting enhancements to AMD's ROC-tracer monitoring library that are needed to complete support for adding GPU kernels to call paths collected at the point where GPU operations are invoked. Currently, the leaves of call paths  for GPU kernel invocations end in the placeholder \verb|<gpu kernel>| and lack the name of the kernel invoked. This more greatly affects trace lines for GPU streams in \hpctraceviewer{} where one can only see GPU activity marked by \verb|<gpu kernel>| without being able to readily identify the specific kernels being invoked. The HPCToolkit project team is awaiting completion of additional support in AMD's ROC-tracer monitoring library to address this deficiency.

At present, ROC-tracer lacks support for fine-grain performance measurement of GPU computations on AMD GPUs like the PC sampling supported by NVIDIA's GPUs.

\section{Intel GPUs}

The released version of HPCToolkit does not yet support measurement and analysis of performance on Intel GPUs. A development branch supports measurement of GPU computations launched on Intel GPUs using OpenCL or Intel's new Level 0 runtime. A release of these capabilities if forthcoming.
