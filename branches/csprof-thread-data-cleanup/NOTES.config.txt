---------------
PLATFORM  {set to appropriate value so that platform specific stuff can be treated correctly}

static_link_options   {flags to use so that csprof.o can be build and used for static}

UNWINDER choice {FIXME. Should select choice of xed or libunwind or ...}
STATIC_ONLY  {catchall, replace with appropriate set of other config vars}
NO_MMAP    {memory management, (cata,cnl do not have mmap, so can't use it)}
USE_TRAMP  {use trampoline}
DO_THREADS {true if threads are *possible*. DO_THREADS should be false for catamount, cnl}
PERF    {turn PERF on to turn MSG off}
DRIVER  {itimer,papi,sync}

CSPROF_LAST_EDGE_ONLY {don't know}
