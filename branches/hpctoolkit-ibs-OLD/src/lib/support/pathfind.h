/* pathfind - search for named file in given colon-separated pathlist
 * --------
 * Searches for a file named "name" in each directory in the
 * colon-separated pathlist given as the first argument, and returns
 * the full pathname to the first occurence that has at least the mode
 * bits specified by mode. An empty path in the pathlist is
 * interpreted as the current directory.  Returns NULL if 'name' is
 * not found.
 *
 * The following mode bits are understood:
 *    "r" - read access
 *    "w" - write access
 *    "x" - execute access
 *
 * The returned pointer points to an area that will be reused on subsequent
 * calls to this function, and must not be freed by the caller.
 *
 * pathfind_r - (recursively) search for named file in given
 * ----------   colon-separated (recursive) pathlist
 *
 * Same as above, except that for any 'recursive-path', pathfind_r
 * additionally recursively searches all of that path's descendents.
 * A 'recursive-path' is specified by appending a single '*' at
 * the end of the directory.  
 *   /home/.../dir/\*
 * A pathlist can contain a mix of regular and 'recursive-paths':
 *  /home/dir1:/home/dir2/\*:/home/dir3:/home/dir4/\*
 *
 * ** Note: the '*' is escaped with '\' so it does not look like a C-style 
 *    comment; in reality it should not be escaped! **
