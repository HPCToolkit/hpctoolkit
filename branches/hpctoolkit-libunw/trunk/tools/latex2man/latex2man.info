latex2man
*********

Latex2man is a tool to translate UNIX manual pages written with
LaTeXinto a format understood by the UNIX man(1)-command.
Alternatively HTML, TexInfo, or LaTeX code can be produced too.  Output
of parts of the text may be suppressed using the conditional text
feature (for this, LaTeX generation may be used).

Description
===========

Latex2man reads the file INFILE and writes OUTFILE.  The input must be
a LaTeX document using the latex2man LaTeXpackage.  Latex2man
translates that document into the troff(1) format using the -man macro
package.

   Using the -H option, HTML code can be produced, instead of troff(1).

   Using the -T option, TexInfo code can be produced, instead of
troff(1).

   Using the -M option, troff(1) input is produced.

   Using the -L option, LaTeX ouput can be produced, instead of
troff(1).

Options
=======

`-tTRANSFILE'
     Translation for user defined LaTeX macros.

`-M'
     Produce output suitable for the man(1) command (default).

`-H'
     Instead of producing output suitable for the man(1) command, HTML
     code is produced (despite the name of the command).

`-T'
     Instead of producing output suitable for the man(1) command,
     TexInfo code is produced (despite the name of the command). The
     generated `.texi'-file may be processed with makeinfo(1) (to
     produce an `.info'-file) which in turn may be installed using
     install-info(1).  The Info tags @dircategory and @direntry are
     provided.

`-L'
     The LaTeX source is written to the OUTFILE.  This is useful in
     conjunction with the -CNAME option.

`-CNAME'
     Output the conditional text for NAME.  If more than one name
     should be given use quotes: -C'NAME1 NAME2 ...'
     The following names are defined automatically:
        * -H defines HTML

        * -T defines TEXI

        * -M defines MAN

        * -L defines LATEX

`-aCHAR'
     Is used only in conjunction with -T.
     Background:
     TexInfo ignores all blanks before the first word on a new line. In
     order to produce some additional space before that word (using
     \SP) some character has to be printed before the additional space.
     By default this is a . (dot). The CHAR specifies an alternative
     for that first character. Giving a blank to -a supresses the
     indentation of a line.
     Note: only for the first \SP of a series that CHAR is printed.

`-h'
     Show a help text.

`-V'
     Show version information.

LaTeX commands
==============

The LaTeX package latex2man is used to write the Man-pages with
LaTeX.Since we translate into other text formats, not all LaTeX stuff
can be translated.


File: latex2man.info,  Node: Package Options,  Next: Package Specific Environments,  Prev: LaTeX commands,  Up: Top

Package Options
---------------

The latex2man package accepts the following options:

`fancy'
     use the LaTeX package fancyheadings.

`fancyhdr'
     use the LaTeX package fancyhdr.

`nofancy'
     neither the LaTeX package fancyheadings nor fancyhdr are used.

   The default option may be specified in the file latex2man.cfg.


File: latex2man.info,  Node: Package Specific Environments,  Next: Accepted LaTeX Environments,  Prev: Package Options,  Up: Top

Package Specific Environments
-----------------------------

The following environments are provided by the package:
`\begin{Name}{chapter}{name}{author}{info}{title}'
     The Name environment takes five arguments: 1.  the Man-page
     chapter, 2.  the name of the Man-page, 3.  the author, 4.  some
     short information about the tool printed in the footline of the
     Man-page, and 5.  a text which is used as title, for HTML and
     LaTeX (it's ignored for output of the Man-page or TeXinfo. The Name
     environment must be the first environment in the document.
     Processing starts with this environment. Any text before this is
     ignored (exception: the setVersion and setDate commands). (Note:
     all arguments of \begin{Name} must be written on one line).

`\begin{Table}[width]{columns}'
     The Table environment takes two arguments: the first optional one
     specifies a width of the last column, the second one gives the
     number of columns.  For example:

     \begin{Table}[2cm]{3}
     Here & am & I \\\hline
     A 1 & A 2 & A 3 1 2 3 4 5 A 3 1 2 3 4 5 \\
     B 1 & B 2 & B 3 \\
     \end{Table}

     will be typeset as:

     Here                 am                   I
     A 1                  A 2                  A 3 1 2 3 4 5 A 3 1
                                               2 3 4 5
     B 1                  B 2                  B 3

     If no optional _width_ argument is given, all entries are typeset
     left justified.  The _width_ is a length measured absolutly in
     _cm_.  Processing with LaTeX a p{width} column is typeset as last
     column. The translation to troff(1) commands results in a lw(width)
     column specification. Translating to HTML and TexInfo ignores the
     _width_ parameter.

     \hline may be used.

     If the Man-page is formatted with troff(1) and tables are used, the
     tbl(1) preprocessor should be called, usually by giving a -t to
     the call of troff(1).  When viewing the generated manula page
     using man(1), tbl(1) is called automatically.

`\begin{Description}'
     is the same as \begin{description}

`\begin{Description}[label]'
     is similar to \begin{description}, but the item labels have at
     minimum the size of the (optional) word _label_.  The difference
     is visible only in the DVI and PDF-output, not in the troff,
     TexInfo or HTML output.
    `a'
          |a \begin{description}

    `ab'
          |ab

    `abc'
          |abc

    `a'
          |a \begin{Description}

    `ab'
          |ab

    `abc'
          |abc

    `a'
          |a \begin{Description}[aa]

    `ab'
          |ab

    `abc'
          |abc

`\ss,\"a, ...'
     \ss = ss, \"a= a", \"o= o", \"u= u", \"A= A", \"O= O", \"U= U". It
     is allowed to surround these macros in { and } in all places, even
     inside other macros, e.g.
     .     \textbf{\"a\"o\"u\"A\"O\"U\ss}
     .     \textbf{\"a}{\"o}{\"u}{\"A}{\"O}{\"U}{\ss}}
     .     \textbf{‰ˆ¸ƒ÷‹ﬂ}
     *a"o"u"A"O"U"ss a"o"u"A"O"U"ss a"o"u"A"O"U"ss*

     If these letters are used in their LATIN-1 8-bit coding, they are
     translated into the equivalent letter of the desired output format.
     E.g. A" becomes &Auml; in HTML and @"A in texinfo.


File: latex2man.info,  Node: Conditional Text,  Next: Translation of User Defined Macros,  Prev: Accepted LaTeX Macros,  Up: Top

Conditional Text
----------------

latex2man preprocesses the LaTeX input to allow text to be used
conditionally. A special sort of LaTeX comment is used for that purpose.
   * %@% IF _condition_ %@%

   * %@% ELSE %@%

   * %@% END-IF %@%

   A line must contain only such a comment and nothing else. _condition_
is a boolean expression containing "names" and operators. The names
given with the -CNAME option have the value "true", while all other
names occuring in the expression are assumed to be "false". If the
evaluation of the boolean expression results in the value "true", the
text in the "then"-part is used and the text in the optional
"else"-part is skipped (and vice versa). The IF/ELSE/END-IF may be
nested. As boolean operators the following are allowed:

||                               boolean or
&&                               boolean and
!                                negation

   ( and ) for grouping are allowed.

For example:
%@% IF abc %@%
abc set
%@%  IF xyz %@%
xyz set
%@%  ELSE %@%
xyz NOT set
%@%  END-IF %@%
%@% ELSE %@%
abc NOT set
%@%  IF xyz || !XYZ %@%
xyz OR !XYZ set
%@%  ELSE %@%
xyz OR !XYZ NOT set
%@%  END-IF %@%
%@% END-IF %@%

Run this manual page through latex2man with e.g.  -C'ABC XYZ' and have
a look to the generated output.  (If simply running the LaTeX-document
through LaTeX,all lines are shown in the .dvi file).
abc NOT set
xyz OR !XYZ set
To check the conditional text feature, when latex2man is called with
`-CHTML'
     the lines 1a, 2b, 3b, and 4b;

`-CTEXI'
     the lines 1b, 2a, 3b, and 4b;

`-CMAN'
     the lines 1b, 2b, 3a, and 4b;

`-CLATEX'
     the lines 1b, 2b, 3b, and 4a;

`calling LaTeX without preprocessing'
     all lines
   should be shown:

   1b. The HTML conditional was not set.

   2a. This text occurs only when viewing the TEXI output

   3b. The MAN conditional was not set.

   4b. The LATEX conditional was not set.

Translation of User Defined Macros
----------------------------------

The user macro translation file (given by the [ -tTRANSFILE ]) contains
Perl commands specifying the translation of LaTeX macros defined by the
user. These macros may have none, one or two arguments. The following
code is expected:

   * Comments start with a # up to the end of the line.

   * For a macro \foo with no arguments, the following code must be
     specified:
    `Translation to Man-Pages'
          $manMacro{'foo'} = '...';

    `Translation to HTML'
          $htmlMacro{'foo'} = '...';

    `Translation to TexInfo'
          $texiMacro{'foo'} = '...';

     where ... is the translation.

   * For a macro \foo{..} with one argument, the following code must be
     specified:
    `Translation to Man-Pages'
          $manMacro1a{'foo'} = '...';
          $manMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

    `Translation to HTML'
          $htmlMacro1a{'foo'} = '...';
          $htmlMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

    `Translation to TexInfo'
          $texiMacro1a{'foo'} = '...';
          $texiMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

     where ... is the translation. The 1a code is used before the
     argument, while 1b is typeset after the argument is set.

   * For a macro \foo{..}{..} with two arguments, the following code
     must be specified:
    `Translation to Man-Pages'
          $manMacro2a{'foo'} = '...';
          $manMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
          $manMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

    `Translation to HTML'
          $htmlMacro2a{'foo'} = '...';
          $htmlMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
          $htmlMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

    `Translation to TexInfo'
          $texiMacro2a{'foo'} = '...';
          $texiMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
          $texiMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

     where ... is the translation. The 2a code is used before the first
     argument, 2b between the two arguments and 2c is typeset after the
     second argument is set.

   * The file `latex2man.trans' contains some example code.

General Remarks
---------------

  1. Empty lines are typeset as paragraph separators.

  2. The arguments of the LaTeX commands must not be split over several
     lines.

  3. Do not nest calls to macros.

  4. Except the mentioned environment and macros, the usage of other
     LaTeX environments or macros are not translated. Their usage will
     cause garbage in the output.

  5. latex2man requires Perl version >= 5.0004_03.
