Splay tree lookup for PC address to interval.

Add these files to BetterUnwind directory.
They should fit in unmodified (I think).

These files are already in BetterUnwind (unchanged),
just keep the ones already there.

splay.c defines two external functions to call (in splay.h):

void csprof_interval_tree_init(void);
unwind_interval *csprof_addr_to_interval(unsigned long addr);

Notes:

1. Lightly tested on ada.  The asm code in simple-lock requires x86_64
or ia64 architechture.

2. I went with the slicky trick of overlaying the unwind interval
struct with the splay tree node struct.  It was simple and saves any
effort of converting to some other format.  We may want to revisit
this at some point.

3. The splay tree insert code only does a little sanity checking on
the intervals that it gets.  At some point, I'd like to do more
checking that the intervals are in order and don't overlap with
existing tree intervals, etc.

4. Is there some reason that simple-lock/unlock uses longs instead of
int or char?
