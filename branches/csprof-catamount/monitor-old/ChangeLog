     	- Standardized MONITOR_DEBUG and MONITOR_ERROR callbacks.
	- Bulletproof library call interceptions, checking against NULL
	  at runtime for the case when other libraries _init sections run
	  before ours, like Pathscale OpenMP. 
	- Proper types for callng function call pointers.
	- Conditionalize pthread_self() usage. Linux only needs gettid() BTW.
	- Removed code that needed GOMP_parallel_end().
	- Race detection for monitor_thread_count variable.
	- Last revision, 33333
2/16/07 mucci
	- Added code to handle OpenMP runtimes that create threads during
	_init like pathscale.
2/14/07 mucci
	- Install docs to /usr/share/doc/monitor-version
	- Major code cleanup
	- Standardized debug, warning and error messages
	- Added test drivers and verify script
	- Moved to gettid() where available otherwise defined USE_PTHREAD_SELF
	- Moved monitor_gettid() to be unsigned long
	- Made runtests and verify take -v (verbose) and -h (help) arguments
	- Added execshell test case
	- Documented USE_PTHREAD_SELF and USE_PTHREAD_CLEANUP_PUSH_POP in
	  INSTALL file
2/7/07 mucci
	- Fixed ifdef for SYS_fork
12/21/06 mucci
	- Added monitor_real_fork/dlopen/execve/exit
	- Added monitor_real_exit test case
	- Added -DUSE_CLEANUP_PUSH_POP for pthreads, remove to
	  remove dependency on pthreads lib.
12/14/06 mucci
	- Added fallback syscalls to fork, execve and exit.
12/13/06 mucci
	- Fixed GCC/OpenMP implementation to pass thread specific variable
	- Extended API to include pointers to argc and argv.
	- Added call for real exit for tools to bail without callbacks.
	- Added call for forcing process fini callback for processes with
	  additional runtime systems, like MPI.
	- Improved documentation.
	- Now using pthread_cleanup_push/pop to handle cases where pthread_exit() is used.
	- Added numerous test cases for good and bad pthread usage.
	- Added BUGS, TODO file
12/10/06 mucci
	- Fixed MONITOR_INC_PATH rule
11/22/06 mucci
	- Fixed build issue for testtool2.so
	- Added an argument to the test driver for single test case handling
	- Added support for the braindead implementation of GCC/OpenMP
	  the problem is that those threads never return from the function
	  passed to Pthread create. The only penalty is that the thread 
	  completion handler no longer has access to the thread specific
	  data.
11/20/06 mucci
	- Added lib.so as an install target
	- Added LDFLAGS to final link
11/3/06 mucci
        - Fixed CC assignment in Rules.gmake
        - Added -DPIC to build
	- Fixed path to libmonitor in test script
	- Updated to install in /usr/local like configure.
9/19/06 v0.99rc9 mucci
	- DESTDIR support for ebuilds
	- Weak symbol binding fixes (10/16/06)
7/20/06 v0.99rc8 mucci

	- Added MONITOR_OPTIONS environment variable
	- Consisent calling of fini_library and fini_process
	  with abnormal termination.
	- Cleaned up calls to exit throughout the library to avoid recursion.

7/17/06 mucci

	- Added loads of debugging, compiled with -DDEBUG
	- Some selinux stuff calls dlopen before _init sections.
	- Moved to gcc 4 openmp and gcj -C
	- OpenMP in GCC4 doesn't appear to ever return from it's threads
