1) monitor has no way to catch pthreads that
have not called pthread_exit() or returned from
the function passed to directly to pthread_create(). 

2) pthread_cancel() doesn't appear to be handled either.

3) In order to catch threads that call pthread_exit, we have to link 
libmonitor with pthreads due to the cleanup handlers. I will try
to find a workaround.

If anyone has any idea how to handle the cases (badpthreads*) in
the tests directory, let me know at ospat-devel@cs.utk.edu.
