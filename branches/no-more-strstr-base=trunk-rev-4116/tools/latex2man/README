				=========

Latex2man is a tool to translate UNIX manual pages written with LaTeX into
the troff format understood by the UNIX man(1)-command.
Alternatively HTML, TexInfo, or LaTeX code can be produced too.
Output of parts of the text may be supressed using the conditional text
feature (for this, LaTeX generation may be used).

There is LaTeX package (latex2man.sty) used for writing the Man-page
and a PERL script (latex2man) doing the actual translation.

Requirements:
 - Latex2man requires Perl version >= 5.0004_03.
 - LaTeX2e

VERSION: 1.23
