\begin{Name}{1}{hpcstruct}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{The HPCToolkit Performance Tools}{hpcstruct:\\ Recovery of Static Program Structure}

\Prog{hpcstruct} recovers the static program structure of \emph{fully optimized} object code for use with an \textbf{HPCToolkit} correlation tool.
In particular, \Prog{hpcstruct}, recovers source code procedures and loop nests, detects inlining, and associates procedures and loops with object code addresses.
See \HTMLhref{hpctoolkit.html}{\Cmd{hpctoolkit}{1}} for an overview of \textbf{HPCToolkit}.

\end{Name}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Synopsis}

\Prog{hpcstruct} \oOpt{options} \Arg{binary}

Typical usage:\\
\SP\SP\SP\Prog{hpcstruct} \Arg{binary}\\
which creates \File{basename(}\Arg{binary}\File{).hpcstruct}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Description}

Given an application binary or DSO \Arg{binary}, \Prog{hpcstruct} recovers the program structure of its object code.
Program structure is a mapping of a program's static source-level structure to its object code.
By default, \Prog{hpcstruct} writes its results to the file \File{basename(<binary>).hpcstruct}.
This file is typically passed to \textbf{HPCToolkit}'s correlation tool, \HTMLhref{hpcprof.html}{\Cmd{hpcprof}{1}} or \HTMLhref{hpcprof-flat.html}{\Cmd{hpcprof-flat}{1}}.

\Prog{hpcstruct} is designed primarily for highly optimized binaries created from C, C++ and Fortran source code.
Because \Prog{hpcstruct}'s algorithms exploit a binary's debugging information, for best results, \Arg{binary} should be compiled with standard debugging information.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Arguments}

\begin{Description}
\item[\Arg{binary}] An executable binary or dynamically linked library.
Note that \Prog{hpcstruct} does not recover program structure for libraries that \Arg{binary} depends on.  To create such information, run hpcstruct on each dynamically linked library (or relink your program with static versions of the libraries).
\end{Description}

Default values for an option's optional arguments are shown in \{\}.

\subsection{Options: Informational}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptoArg{-v}{n}, \OptoArg{--verbose}{n}]
Verbose: generate progress messages to stderr at verbosity level \Arg{n}.  \{1\}

\item[\Opt{-V}, \Opt{--version}]
Print version information.

\item[\Opt{-h}, \Opt{--help}]
Print help.

\item[\OptoArg{--debug}{n}]
Debug: use debug level \Arg{n}. \{1\}

\item[\OptArg{--debug-proc}{glob}]
Debug structure recovery for procedures matching the procedure glob \Arg{glob}.
\end{Description}


\subsection{Options: Structure recovery}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptArg{-I}{path}, \OptArg{--include}{path}] 
Use \Arg{path} when resolving source file names. 
This option is useful when a compiler records the same filename in \emph{different} ways within the symbolic information.
(Yes, this does happen.)
For a recursive search, append a '*' after the last slash, e.g., \verb+'/mypath/*'+ (quote or escape to protect from the shell). 
May pass multiple times.

\item[\OptArg{--loop-intvl}{yes|no}]
Should loop recovery heuristics assume an irreducible interval is a loop? \{yes\}.

\item[\OptArg{--loop-fwd-subst}{yes|no}]
Should loop recovery heuristics assume forward substitution may occur? \{yes\}.

\item[\OptArg{-N}{all|safe|none}, \OptArg{--normalize}{all|safe|none}]
Specify normalizations to apply to program structure. \{all\}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{all}: apply all normalizations
  \item \textbf{safe}: apply only safe normalizations
  \item \textbf{none}: apply no normalizations
  \end{itemize}

\item[\OptArg{-R}{'old-path=new-path'}, \OptArg{--replace-path}{'old-path=new-path'}]
Substitute instances of \Arg{old-path} with \Arg{new-path}; apply to all paths (e.g., a profile's load map and source code) for which \Arg{old-path} is a prefix.  Use '\\' to escape instances of '=' within a path. May pass multiple times.
  
Use this option when a profile or binary contains references to files that have been relocated, such as might occur with a file system change.
\end{Description}


\subsection{Options: Output}

\begin{Description}

\item[\OptArg{-o}{file}, \OptArg{--output}{file}]
Write results to \Arg{file}.  Use `-' for \File{stdout}. \{\File{basename(}\Arg{binary}\File{).hpcstruct}\}

\item[\Opt{--compact}]
Generate compact output, eliminating extra white space.

% \item[\OptArg{-p}{path-list}, \OptArg{--canonical-paths}{path-list}] Ensure that scope tree only contains files found in the colon-separated path list \Arg{path-list}. May be passed multiple times.

\end{Description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Examples}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item 
Assume we have collected profiling information for the (optimized) binary \File{sweep3dsingle}, compiled with debugging information.
We wish to recover program structure in the file \File{sweep3dsingle.hpcstruct} for use with \HTMLhref{hpcprof.html}{\Cmd{hpcprof}{1}} or \HTMLhref{hpcprof-flat.html}{\Cmd{hpcprof-flat}{1}}.
To do this, execute:
\begin{verbatim}
    hpcstruct sweep3dsingle
\end{verbatim}

%\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Notes}

\begin{enumerate}

\item For best results, an application binary should be compiled with debugging information.
To generate debugging information while also enabling optimizations, use the appropriate variant of \verb+-g+ for the following compilers:
\begin{itemize}
\item GNU compilers: \verb+-g+
\item Intel compilers: \verb+-g -debug inline_debug_info+
\item PathScale compilers: \verb+-g+
\item PGI compilers: \verb+-gopt+
%\item Compaq and SGI MIPSpro compilers: \verb+-g3+
%\item Sun Compilers: \verb+-g -xs+
\end{itemize}

\item While \Prog{hpcstruct} attempts to guard against inaccurate debugging information, some compilers (notably PGI's) often generate invalid and inconsistent debugging information.
Garbage in; garbage out.

\item C++ mangling is compiler specific. On non-GNU platforms, \Prog{hpcstruct}
tries both platform's and GNU's demangler.

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Bugs}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \Prog{hpcstruct} may incorrectly infer the structure of loops contained within switch statements.
When reconstructing the control flow graph (CFG) of the object code, \Prog{hpcstruct} currently ignores indirect jumps and does not add edges from the jump to possible target basic blocks.
The result is an incomplete CFG and a misleading loop nesting tree.
The workaround is to use an if/elseif/else statement.

\end{enumerate}
