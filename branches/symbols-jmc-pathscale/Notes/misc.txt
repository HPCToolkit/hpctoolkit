verify that differences between old and new stapi_syms runs (see d.txt) are
valid.

oldfns.txt contains the addresses that old stapi_syms identified as stripped functions that
 new stapi does NOT think are stripped functions because they fall into conditional branch
 range [No call instructions that call to an address that lies in a conditional branch range
 is a valid call].

newfns.txt contains the stripped functions that new stapi_syms found, but that old stapi
 did NOT discover.

/tmp/boost is disassembly of boost thread stuff of interest
 copied to ./boost.dis.txt for posterity

oldfns.txt checked by inspection using the chk.gdb debug macro
