This, the hpctoolkit-prof branch, is Mark's branch for beginning work
on making hpctoolkit more scalable for our use of files.  I'm working
backwards from the viewer to hpcrun.  Step 1 is between hpcprof and
the viewer to make prof write files in a compact binary format and not
write one file per process or thread.
