                          his bugfix of the problem he found:
                          "I came across another issue in the latest
                           latex2man - if the source file has "\verb+.foo+" in
                           it, then the ".foo" will be copied to the man page
                           verbatim and if it happens to be placed on the
                           beginning of a line, then troff will consider it to
                           be a command and not display it properly."
