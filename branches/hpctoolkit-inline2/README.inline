This, the hpctoolkit-inline2 branch, is a short-lived, temporary
branch to prepare code for static inline support from SymtabAPI.

The other hpctoolkit-inline branch is a hacked proof of concept.
This is the branch that will be merged back into trunk.

Don't expect this branch to always build or run cleanly.  When it's
featured enough, I'll add directions on building the latest symtab
from git with cmake.
