This directory contains a series of small binaries, each built from a single source file. The following suffixes are
used to mark which compiler and options were used to compile the binary:

The following source files are compiled as above:

- `inlines+loops.*`: Inlined functions and loops, interleaved in a few different patterns.
- `recursion.*`: Recursive functions and call graphs.

All binaries can be built from scratch by running `./build.sh`, provided a working Podman installation.
