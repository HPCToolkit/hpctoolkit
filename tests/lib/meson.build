# Running thread-disruptive <command>... will run the command in an environment where only a single
# random thread is available to the command. Note that this uses affinity, so the command may run
# far slower than expected in this environment.

# Running `meson test --setup=thread-disruptive` runs all tests under this wrapper. Note that doing
# this slows down the tests and as such test timeouts are automatically increased.
