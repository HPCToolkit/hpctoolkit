# This Makefile integrates the smoke tests with automake's 'make
# check'.  First, run configure, make, make install, then cd to this
# directory and run:
#
#   make check
#
# Note:
# 1. run-sort refers to the installed files (hpcrun, etc), so this
# must come after 'make install'.
#
# 2. Automake refers to paths in the build tree, so you must have the
# build tree expanded and run this from the build tree.  (This is why
# it doesn't work with 'spack test run', those tests are run later,
# after install.)
#
# 3. But it does work at spack install time, since the build directory
# still exists.
#
#   spack install --test=root <pkg>
#

# We do not want the standard GNU files (NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog...)
