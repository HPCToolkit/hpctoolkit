Autotools Build Notes
----------------------

This directory is a mini-externals package for building and installing
the autotools packages: autoconf, automake, libtool and m4.  The
directory it builds is suitable for an hpctoolkit /projects/pkgs
directory for autoreconf.

This package serves two purposes: (1) it makes it easy to install
autotools on a new machine for hpctoolkit, and (2) it makes it easy to
keep a consistent version of autotools across machines.  Running
autoreconf with a different version of autotools produces tons of
irrelevent diffs.  So, it is useful to keep a consistent version
across machines.

To install autotools, just run 'make.sh' with the install directory as
argument.  For example:

  ./make.sh  /projects/pkgs/autotools-ac-2.67-am-1.11.1-lt-2.2.10

Autotools uses m4 and some systems have a version that is too old, so
by default make.sh also installs m4.  To avoid installing m4, use the
option -no-m4.

To build each package manually, use:

  ./configure  --prefix=...
  make
  make install

Build in order: m4, autoconf, automake and libtool.  Add prefix/bin to
PATH after each package.
